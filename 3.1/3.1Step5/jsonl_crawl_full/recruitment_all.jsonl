{"id": "m9pbned", "text": "After helping hundreds of people start their own recruiting businesses, here's my practical take on essential tools while keeping costs manageable:\n\nFor Candidate Sourcing:\n\n* LinkedIn Recruiter Lite is solid, but don't overlook Google as a powerful (and free) sourcing tool. Here's a quick hack: Use search strings like \"filetype:XLS technical account manager directory attendee\" to find spreadsheets from tech conferences with candidate contact info. This often surfaces passive candidates you won't find on LinkedIn.\n* Boolean strings on Google can also help you find resumes hosted on personal websites and Github profiles\n\nFor ATS:\n\n* Start with Zoho Recruit ($30/month) or Freshteam's free tier\n* Many solo recruiters I know actually start with a well-organized Google Drive system + spreadsheet. It's not fancy but it works until you scale\n\nFor Contact Finding:\n\n* Apollo.io is a solid alternative to ZoomInfo. Their free tier gives you 20 credits/month\n* Hunter.io + Chrome extension for email finding (free tier available)\n* Clearbit Connect (Gmail extension) gives you 100 free email lookups monthly\n\nFor Email Marketing:\n\n* SendGrid's free tier (100 emails/day)\n* Sendinblue has better pricing than Mailchimp for small volumes\n\nOne important note: Focus your budget on LinkedIn first. I see too many new recruiters trying to use every tool under the sun. In reality, you can start making placements with just:\n\n* LinkedIn Recruiter Lite\n* Basic Google Workspace\n* A simple CRM/spreadsheet system\n\nOnce you make your first placement (typically $20-30k fee), then you can reinvest in more sophisticated tools.", "timestamp": "2025-01-28T20:52:19Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "Seeking recommendations for essential tools and software for a one person recruitment firm.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Recruitment/comments/1fazz4s/seeking_recommendations_for_essential_tools_and/"}}

For a small startup though? Skip the fancy stuff. Most of those systems are built for companies that have dedicated recruiting teams and honestly they'll just slow you down when you're trying to move fast. Like we had greenhouse at one point and it took our hiring managers 45 minutes just to figure out how to leave feedback on a candidate.\n\nFor your size I'd probably just use something super lightweight - maybe even just airtable with some automations? We did that at my friend's startup when they were under 20 people and it worked great. You can build custom forms for applications, set up different views for each stage, add whatever fields you want. Plus it's like $20/month instead of the $500+ that most ATS charge. The remote thing isn't really an issue - every tool works fine for remote hiring these days. What matters more is having a clear process that everyone follows.\n\nThe customization question is interesting though.. most founders think they need all these custom stages and special questions but then never actually use them. At Stellar Health we had this elaborate 7-stage process with custom scorecards and guess what? Half the hiring managers just skipped straight to \"let's bring them onsite\" anyway.

{"id": "nh0xaef", "text": "This is a fantastic, brutally honest take, and I genuinely appreciate you taking the time to write it. Seriously. This is exactly the kind of unfiltered feedback that is so hard to get and so valuable.\n\nYou've hit on some points that are 100% valid. I can absolutely see how my post comes across as leading with the \"AI\" buzzword instead of the actual problems. That's a fair cop, and your point about selling benefits, not features (or in this case, the tech behind the features), is well-taken.\n\nLet me try and reframe, because you're right, the vision isn't about 'AI for AI's sake'. It's about using it to solve the specific, soul-crushing admin tasks that I, and many others, have dealt with first-hand.\n\nFor example:\n\n* The first-hand pain is spending the first two hours of your day manually sifting through 150+ irrelevant applications for a single role. The benefit we're building is getting a prioritized shortlist of the top 10 most relevant candidates instantly, so you can start your day by actually speaking to people who are a good fit.\n* The pain is having conversations happening across email, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, and SMS, and trying to keep track of it all. The benefit is having a single, unified inbox that consolidates it all, with an assistant that can suggest replies or schedule the interview directly from the conversation thread.\n* The pain is finishing a 45-minute video call and then spending another 15 minutes typing up notes. The benefit is having that call automatically transcribed, summarized, and key action items added to your to-do list before you've even closed the Zoom window.\n\nYou've absolutely nailed what the foundation of any good system should be: **\"A fast system with a lightweight super usable UI that’s easy to use, gets out the way, and doesn’t try to do everything - with a clear, straightforward pricing model.\"**\n\nThat is our ground zero. If the core ATS/CRM isn't incredibly fast and intuitive, then any extra features, AI-powered or not, are just lipstick on a pig. The goal is to build that solid foundation first and then use the tech to eliminate the manual work that gets in the way of recruiters actually recruiting.\n\nYour advice to \"ban the word AI\" is ringing in my ears. While we won't ban the tech itself, this is a very strong reminder for us to ban it from our *messaging* and focus purely on the problems we solve and the time we save.\n\nThis was genuinely helpful.

{"id": "nh5w25d", "text": "I agree with you 100% on the foundation. The absolute priority has to be a **clean, fast, and intuitive CRM that just works**. If the core system is clunky, nothing else matters. Your decision to opt for that proves that many new platforms are failing on this basic, essential promise.\n\nWhere I'd offer a bit of pushback is on the idea that it has to be a choice between a 'simple CRM' and an 'AI platform'. The problem is that AI is often treated as a flashy, separate 'feature' that you have to go out of your way to use, which is what makes it feel cumbersome and bloated.\n\nMy belief is that when it's done right, AI should be almost invisible. It shouldn't feel like an extra task. It should be woven into the background of your existing workflow, simply removing the friction.\n\nFor example:\n\n* You shouldn't have to click a \"Parse CV with AI\" button. You should just upload a CV, and the candidate's profile, skills, and experience timeline are automatically and accurately filled out for you. You didn't do an extra step; a step was just removed from your process.\n* You shouldn't have to navigate to a separate \"AI screening\" module. When you drag a candidate into your \"screening\" pipeline stage, the system should simply ask, \"Want to send them the video screening questions for this role?\". It’s an intelligent layer on top of an action you were already taking.\n* The goal isn't to make recruiters use 'AI features'. The goal is to make the 50 small, annoying admin tasks they do every day simply disappear into the background.\n\nYour experience sounds like a perfect example of what happens when that seamless integration isn't quite there yet. It highlights the massive gap between a cool tech demo and a tool that genuinely makes your day easier without being a burden.

{"id": "my2n8gb", "text": "Fine fine, \n\nI'll bite; but only because you asked nicely, I'm currently waiting for something and I intend to copy paste this to the guy who asks this next week.  You get this one free of charge, any further insights I'm going to send an invoice for.  \n\nFirst of all ; Market saturation.  \n\nCurrently the recruitment market is saturated with tooling and specifically AI powered tooling.  These can mostly be put into a few groupings.  \n\n1) Large corporations with a ton of backing.  Big companies who are investing heavily into a one single solution for internal use.  Think Adecco and the like.    \n  \n2) People who already in the industry creating tools.  Those can be very stealthy (Quickli is the BEST sourcing tool nobody knows about) or more in the open like Tooled up Raccoons and Sourcicle.  (I'm very much showing my niche in recruitment here).  These are tools that have inherent trust because you have people in the industry connected to this.  \n\n3) Smaller companies who are already established and selling via sponsorship, brand recognition, etc. etc. etc.  A few weeks ago , 50skills (Workflow automation) invited a ton of people for an evening to test out their product and free drinks.  It kinda worked because it created buzz.  \n\n4) Ideas, created by people outside our industry, with limited knowledge of how or why recruitment is the way it is.  They tend to focus only on the \"happy flow\" and think all of this can be automated.  The kind of people who will implement a system where a candidate is forced to mail their CV and then watch their whole system break down because the candidate ONLY wants to send their CV via whatsapp.  I can easily say I see about 2-3 of these pop up every week between Reddit, my Linkedin and my email.  Some of them are actually decent ideas.  A lot of them are absolutely garbage ideas which should never see the light of day.  \n\nI tend to no longer even bother with the 4th category, because I have a job and nobody is paying me to argue with people.  Especially not those who don't want to be convinced.  \n\nSecond of all ; Tools you are validating ; \n\nResume scanner ; The flaws here are the CV's are inherently flawed documents, so anything you try to match is going to be flawed.  At which point you require human oversight for every scan, invalidating your scanning.  On top of that, research has shown there is a 10% gender bias in every LLM.  (Not even talking about other bias).  And the EU laws will eat you alive.  Thus invalidating a large part of your market before you even begin.  \n\nAI chatbot for an ATS; See above for flaws, but has more \"reason to be made\".  Your biggest problem here is that there are 1000 ATS out there, most of them won't allow you to do this (because they want this themselves) or you will have to make an extension for every ATS.  You can probably do this in any ATS without AI. \n\nAutomated AI interview ; Candidates hate this.  Candidates will drop out of your process.  As soon as you try to implement this, all data will show you will have a lot more candidates dropping out.  This is because recruitment is inherently a trust based exchange and people no longer trust AI.  You also don't need AI for this.  Cammio already does this , since before we had AI.  (And probably already implemented this).  \n\nBiggest pain points that recruiters really have ;   \nCandidate sourcing (A ton of people claim they automated this, my rebuttal would be that Linkedin and CV's are flawed and AI lacks the insight on this part.  Linkedin is also very against any automation they aren't doing themselves and their automation sucks all the balls).   \nCandidates going outside of whatever happy flow your company has implemented.    \nHiring managers are really bad at following up   \nHiring managers don't really know what the hell they want in a candidate.  \n\nA ton of these people could already easily automate with an N8N, 50skills or zapier on their own.  \n\nThe biggest problem you will have selling your solution to any of these ;   \nSmaller companies don't have the budget for anything, bigger companies want a full code review and full compliance to all laws.  Bigger companies are most likely developing something in house and want it fully customised.  Which means Analists, 6-9 months implementation time and whatnot.  \n\nThe market is oversaturated and if I built the perfect recruitment solution (You give me a vacancy, I have the system spit out the PERFECT candidates, who are hire ready, send them a  message and take care of everything until the first interview). If I had that solution I would not be able to sell it because of the huge amount of other tools creating noise and the amount of people selling absolute bullshit about their product and what it can do.   \n\nHow is that for useful insights?", "timestamp": "2025-06-16T12:59:16Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "Recruiters, what’s your biggest headache right now?

{"id": "lxr8wx2", "text": "After building a tool that can source, screen, and analyze candidates, I wanted to share a few reflections on the journey so far and the lessons learned.\n\nThe initial MVP I developed was aimed at addressing a specific challenge: helping recruiters efficiently screen both inbound and outbound candidates, without relying solely on keywords. Traditional keyword searches often miss the nuance of a candidate's true potential, so we implemented a system that ranks candidates using vectors and semantic search, which considers the meaning behind words rather than just matching keywords. This deeper approach generates a detailed report that helps recruiters determine if a candidate is a good fit, focusing especially on technical skills, relevant projects, and experiences aligned with the job description. For example, if a job requires experience in building scalable systems, the report would highlight specific projects that demonstrate a candidate's ability to meet that requirement. The goal is to enable recruiters to have more informed and meaningful conversations about a candidate's projects and contributions.\n\nThrough conversations with experienced leaders in the recruitment space, I realized that adding sourcing capabilities was critical. We decided to bring in public profiles from across Canada, since we are based here and wanted to start local. However, sourcing public profiles comes with its own set of challenges—it’s a lot like headhunting. Sometimes, the contact information isn't entirely accurate, and you still need tools like LinkedIn to get the right details. For instance, phone numbers and emails can often be outdated or incomplete, meaning that even with a strong sourcing tool, recruiters need to verify and supplement the information with other platforms.\n\nSo, is the tool solving the problem? Yes, but it's important to be realistic—it’s solving about 70-80% of the recruitment workflow. It empowers recruiters with actionable data points, but it doesn't replace the need for human judgment and interaction. Recruitment is ultimately about people, and while tools can significantly reduce the workload, human insight remains irreplaceable. For example, understanding a candidate's motivation or cultural fit is something that still requires personal interaction, something no tool can fully replicate.\n\nThat’s my take.

{"id": "lk0d3w3", "text": "OK, this is what I tell everyone. If you have a LinkedIn premium account. I’m talking about LinkedIn sales navigator, LinkedIn, recruiter, light, or LinkedIn recruiter than it seems that LinkedIn gives you much more freedom to use third-party software tools as long as you don’t go overboard. I don’t know this to be true but anecdotally and when I say anecdotally, I mean about 100 other recruiters that I’m connected with in different Facebook groups and during the recruiter roundtable that I do every Friday, I’ve never had a strike against me, been banned, been put in LinkedIn, jail, etc. and I use lots of third-party tools.\n\nI use-\n\nSalesQl to scrape￼ 25 profiles at a time to get phone numbers and email addresses and those profiles get extracted to their website right and then download a CSV of all those profiles to put into my applicant tracking system\n\nKanbox to scrape hundreds of profiles at a time and do anywhere from 75 to 125 automated LinkedIn connections a week\n\nLoxo chrome extension to easily put a LinkedIn profile into my applicant tracking system with all the pertinent information and if I put them in as a contact it will create a company profile as well\n\nI also have  useArtemis and Clodura. ￼ These are similar, sourcing type software‘s like signal higher, zoom info, Apollo, etc.. and I’ve used their Chrome extension to scrape hundreds of LinkedIn profiles as well. \n\nThe cheapest LinkedIn premium, and in my opinion the best, is LinkedIn sales navigator if you sign up through the Apple App Store. It’s $79 a month and it comes with 50 inmails that will roll over to 150 max if you don’t use them. You also get one free job posting a month. The only negative is if you’re really into sending lots of in￼mails and/or you use “open to work” all the time for searching than you’re better off going with LinkedIn recruiter or LinkedIn recruiter light.\n\nNow, if you use any of these tools on a OG LinkedIn profile, you have to be really careful cause they will put the hammer down on you.  Also, if you’re from another country, there have been some issues, even with premium accounts, getting in trouble for doing too much stuff on LinkedIn with third-party tools.\n\nOne of my part-time recruiters lives in El Salvador and he had a LinkedIn navigator account and he ended up getting banned for one of the scraping tools he was using", "timestamp": "2024-08-26T13:26:46Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "Are Recruiters Using AI for LinkedIn Automation?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Recruitment/comments/1f0fax2/are_recruiters_using_ai_for_linkedin_automation/"}}

Even my own system initially flagged him as a high-match based on the sheer density of his growth marketing vocabulary.\n\nBut I didn't design this to count keywords. I designed it to analyse the logic of the claims. When I looked at the Risk Audit, the system flagged one specific sentence: Spend claims linked to 'simulated environments'.\n\nCandidate didn't actually manage $50k of real company capital. He had completed a high-end marketing bootcamp where he ran a **simulated** $50k budget in a sandbox.\n\nTechnically he didn't lie, he structured the resume so that a human skimming for 6 seconds would credit him with $600k in annual spend experience he doesn't actually have.\n\nInstead of just a \"Match Score\" the system generated a specific interview prompt for the recruiter:\n\n*\"Candidate claims $50k spend but context suggests sandbox. Focus interview on specific 'Real-World Budget Risk' and 'Platform Billing' experience to verify\"*\n\nWe are entering an era where resumes are being written by LLMs to satisfy keyword filters. If your tech stack is just looking for strings like \"Managed $50k,\" you are going to fill your pipeline with \"Test Takers\" who know the jargon but have never felt the pressure of wasting real money.\n\nA \"90% Match\" is meaningless if the logic behind the keywords is hollow.\n\n**TL;DR:** Intelligent system to audit hiring logic caught a \"perfect\" candidate who used keywords to hide that his $50k spend experience was just a bootcamp simulation.

{"id": "o2tgh5p", "text": "I've worked with some recruiting agencies on AI workflows (not a recruiter myself), and over the last year I’ve seen a lot of tools being tested, dropped, or kept because they actually save time.\n\nAI in recruiting feels noisy right now, so I wanted to share a breakdown of tools that deliver real value in 2026.\n\n**The tools that consistently come up:**\n\n• **Clay** – Extremely powerful for data enrichment and lead research (candidates *and* clients). Great for scoring leads and personalization.  \nDownside: steep learning curve, credits get expensive fast, and it’s not plug-and-play.\n\n• **Email finders (Anyfinder / similar tools)** – Simple but effective. Finding + verifying emails reliably still matters, especially for outreach. Paying only for verified emails makes a big difference.\n\n• **ChatGPT (used properly)** – Most recruiters underuse it. It’s strongest for:\n\n* outreach drafts &amp; follow-ups\n* job descriptions &amp; candidate summaries\n* thinking partner for decisions It really shines when integrated into other tools instead of used standalone.\n\n• **Lemlist** – Solid for personalized outreach at scale (email + LinkedIn). Strong deliverability and analytics. Expensive, but usually worth it if outreach volume is high.\n\n• **Read AI (or similar meeting assistants)** – Huge time saver for interviews and client calls. Automatic notes, summaries, and even sentiment insights. Lets recruiters focus on the conversation instead of note-taking.\n\n**Big takeaway:**  \nIn my opinion, no single tool “automates recruiting.” The real gains come from **connecting multiple tools into one workflow** (e.g.: getting data → scoring → outreach → follow-up). That’s where agencies actually save time and scale.\n\nI put together a longer breakdown with examples in this youtube video:\n\n[https://youtu.be/ybPrt-n9KqA?si=Y5skZsX\\_vFPJ8H9u](https://youtu.be/ybPrt-n9KqA?si=Y5skZsX_vFPJ8H9u)\n\nWhat AI tools are you guys actually using day-to-day?", "timestamp": "2026-01-31T17:06:04Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "🤖 [MONTHLY MEGATHREAD] AI &amp; Automation in Recruitment: Tools, Trends, and Ethics", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Recruitment/comments/1qdhp7a/monthly_megathread_ai_automation_in_recruitment/"}}

Let me add some context on the VOIP point -&gt;\n\nA big part of why Atlas feels intuitive is because so much of the product is built on *structured events* coming from calls: transcripts create memory that creates recommendations that creates automation. For that to work well, we need deep, native API integrations.\n\nThere are 30+ VOIP providers in the market, all with different APIs, standards, and reliability levels. If we tried to build and maintain full integrations with every provider, we’d spend all our engineering time shipping 30 versions of the same feature and none of the features you listed in your pros would exist. \n\nSo here’s where we are today:\n\n* We’ve integrated RingCentral, Ringover, Devyce and Aircall because they cover the vast majority of usage across our customer base.\n* We actually subsidise switching costs. If someone wants to move provider, we often cover licence discounts to make it painless.\n* When a large customer (say, 100+ seats) comes in with a specific VOIP requirement, we do make commercial decisions to build that integration.\n\nIt’s not that we don’t want more VOIP options, it’s that doing *all* of them would slow product velocity to a crawl.

First, what's their data freshness like? I've seen tools that pull contact info that's 6+ months old and you end up with bounces everywhere. Also ask about their compliance setup - especially if you're reaching out to EU candidates, GDPR is no joke. Get specifics on how they handle opt-outs and data deletion requests. And definitely dig into their email warming features - if they don't have solid domain reputation management built in, your emails will hit spam folders fast.\n\nThe biggest thing though - these tools are only as good as your messaging and targeting. I watched a company blow through $15k/month on one of these platforms because they were spraying generic messages to everyone with \"data\" in their title. Ask your colleague to show you actual campaign performance - open rates, response rates, meeting booked rates. Not just \"we placed 5 people\" but the full funnel metrics. Also find out if they have any built-in A/B testing for messages or if you're flying blind.

Traditional stages for corporate jobs (in house recruiting) from start to finish include: headcount budget approval, planning the hiring strategy, posting job ads and job description to all channels, sourcing (targeted search for lead generation), resume screening, recruiter screening call, hiring manager review,  interview with hiring manager, either a technical assessment done live or as a take home assignment or another interview to vet candidate, final interview rounds with stakeholders, maybe an executive interview round, offer negotiation, offer extension, offer acceptance, reference check and background check, pre-onboarding, start date.   \n\n2. Findem has an AI chatbot feature to generate leads for specific roles and to provide clarification on a candidate’s background. It’s not that great; the chatbot just gives terrible advice that I would expect from an entry level person who has never recruited.   ChatGPT can generate a decent job description copy, list of job titles, interview questions, and email templates for outreaching. \n\n3.   AI is Mostly used in lead generation, email marketing ,and planning. Also can be helpful with voice transcription during live meetings over zoom.\n\n4. AI doesn’t have a practical place in the actual recruiting phase when recruiters interact with candidates. Even voice transcription have limits with recognizing accents and new terms. Plus you need permission from candidates in 2 party agreement states to record voice. AI simply helps the recruiter speed up the grunt work of writing job descriptions, drafting email templates, generating interview questions, and explaining terminology. AI chatbots rely on the search parameters and the accurate data model doesn’t exist for a machine learning model to use for training or fine tuning. For example, I used Findem to search for prospective to fill a product designer role. If I only input “product designer” in the job title search field, the algorithm will generate a list of top candidates and recommend they have a high match rate because of the job title and not make inferences based on skills, education, company background, or years of experience. \n\nRealistically, AI will hinder new recruiters from actually learning the fundamental skills to handle complex situations. They may feel their job gets easy with ChatGPT or whatever tool but they will lack critical thinking skills to navigate their job. AI is like giving a Tesla, BMW, or Mercedes to a new student driver who can’t parallel park without a backup camera and sensors.\n\nI prefer to see recruiters to be hands on with manual tools or create their own tools from scratch such as using excel or google spreadsheets then learn automation, process improvements, experimentation, market research, seasonality, pitching, selling, behavioral psychology, and coaching.", "timestamp": "2024-01-20T06:47:34Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "[Academic] What AI tools are used in recruitment these days and what is the process (stages) behind it?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Recruitment/comments/19avid9/academic_what_ai_tools_are_used_in_recruitment/"}}

{"id": "n3ptnax", "text": "Just like most answers here, AI should be used to HELP the recruiter NOT REPLACE him/her. In today’s job market, you have to use AI if you want to stay ahead and keep up with the fast-growing tech industry. It’s also good to organize your work and manage the workload; like some people mentioned here, there are useful tools for note-taking, scheduling, writing JDs etc. So it’s only rational to use AI for these administrative tasks. But what I don’t agree with is to use it for qualifying/interviewing candidates. Because it’s not only disrespectful and unfair to candidates, it can be counterproductive as it may disqualify great candidates. And it can also harm company’s reputation cuz lots of candidates actually hate these AI tools, so if a candidate attends an itv and sees that it’s actually an AI recruiter is the one interviewing them, they will definitely not apply again for that company. So, like I said, i’m a huge advocate of AI in administrative/repetitive tasks but let’s keep the human interaction for humans🙏🏻", "timestamp": "2025-07-17T22:40:49Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "AI in Hiring tools - Yes or No?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Recruitment/comments/1jmizg8/ai_in_hiring_tools_yes_or_no/"}}

{"id": "mrf6qxp", "text": "What level of Apollo subscription are you using? And why not use sales navigator instead?\n\nWhat’s the cost for amplify to scrape the lead data from Apollo? \n\nAre you using ChatGPT API to do this?\n\nWhat happens if they don’t accept the connection invite? You can’t send them a message after that. Are you sending them an email message?  How are you doing the second and third follow if they don’t accept your connection request? \n\n\nTip- you can send 50 connect requests a day if you pay for LinkedIn sales navigator. \n\nIf the cost is more than $50 for Apollo, Phantom busters, and anything else besides Make you might wanna look at jobin. The sequencing has “if this then this” \n\nFor example   \n\nStart by sending a connection request if they accept the connection request then you can follow up with a LinkedIn message or just end the sequence and call them or whatever \n\nIf they don’t accept the connection request after let’s say two days and you have their email address you can send  an email. Let’s say two days later and then another one two days later after that. After those two emails that they still haven’t accepted your connection request you can set it up to withdraw the connection request (keeping your connection requests outstanding under 250 to 300 is a good practice. If you have too many outstanding connection request, LinkedIn will smack you on the pee pee) \n\nIf you don’t have an email address for them, you could probably use a web hook and an api key to scrape an email address and then have make automatically put it into the sequencing and then do the email in two days and then email two days after that. \n\n another really awesome thing, in my opinion, about jobin is there chrome extension scrapes an entire search or an entire lead list in sales navigator or LinkedIn recruiter and OG LinkedIn two. For example, if you build a list out in sales navigator, Elly’s list, that has 623 mechanical engineers on it with one click of the chrome extension it will grab every single profile and stick them into jobin. From there, you could send 50 connection request a day, add them to a sequence, even use LinkedIn filters to check to see if any of those people are “open to work“,  first, second or third degree connections, premium, LinkedIn users, or “open workers” (you can send messages to open workers directly. You don’t need to use inmail) \n\nYour system is pretty awesome though. I really like what make it can do and my applicant tracking system has an open API and one of my colleagues has set up a sequence that basically creates a candidate from an interview just using make. \n\nHe records all of his phone calls and then drops the recording into  a Google Drive folder and then from there make transcribes it using whisper, creates a candidate summary, drop that into a new folder, that then tells the applicant tracking system that that’s a candidate, make puts it into the applicant tracking system and fills out the appropriate fields to create a new candidate, attach is the summary as a document, and then boom all done\n\nI’ve worked and played with make, but I’m stupid so it took me two hours just to have it recognized that a file was dropped into a folder and then move it to another folder and I gave up", "timestamp": "2025-05-09T14:05:48Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "Automatic AI-Powered LinkedIn Outreach with n8n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Recruitment/comments/1khphl3/automatic_aipowered_linkedin_outreach_with_n8n/"}}

Most of them are solid at weeding out the obvious no's but they struggle with nuanced candidates who might not fit the traditional mold but could be amazing hires. You end up missing out on people with unconventional backgrounds or career paths who bring fresh perspectives. The tools tend to favor candidates who know how to game the system rather than those with genuine potential. For skill-based screening, Promap for example focuses on assessments &amp; AI screening that's recorded so you see the questions &amp; answers, vs. a black box.\n\nThe key things I'd watch out for are tools that claim they eliminate bias completely (spoiler alert: they don't, they just shift it around) and anything with black box scoring that you cant explain to candidates later.

{"id": "mx7nbc3", "text": "I’d start by taking a closer look at the requirements in the job ad. If you got 1000 applications, there’s a good chance the criteria weren’t tight enough or at least not clearly communicated. Happens easily with roles like “Data Analyst” that mean different things to different people. Being more specific usually helps with quality and volume.\n\nMost modern ATS tools let you add screening questions to application form. I’d definitely use a few knockout ones to cut down volume. Just a couple of key qualifiers that help you go from 1000 to a smaller and relevant pool. I like to keep the forms short and easy to complete, for better candidate experience.\n\nIf you already have a shortlist of 100, I’d consider building a simple scoring framework to help sort through them. Not a full-blown rubric, but something directional. Some ATS tools have lightweight scorecard features that make this part faster.\n\nI don’t think any tool will guarantee you pick the “right” ones, AI or not. And I wouldn’t send heavy tests to all 100, it’s too much, and you risk losing good candidates. Instead I’d focus on creating a diverse pool of candidates and staying aware of your own screening bias.\n\nDepending on the role and volume, I usually decide whether it’s better to do short phone screening calls with 10–20 candidates or just pick 5 top straight to first interviews. If the role is new to me, I tend to interview more people, it helps me understand what the role really requires in practice and gives me a better sense of the overall skill level in the candidate pool. \n\nI’d do technical testing only after a longer interview or as a separate round with selected candidates.\n\n8+ years in tech recruitment here — in-house + agency roles, Finland / Europe.", "timestamp": "2025-06-11T15:09:57Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "Struggling to screen top 100 data analyst candidates from ATS — is there a better platform or solution?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Recruitment/comments/1l8tlwe/struggling_to_screen_top_100_data_analyst/"}}

They're better suited for the mixed skillset you mentioned (SQL + Excel + business reasoning). TestGorilla has some solid pre-built data analyst assessments that test actual job scenarios rather than just coding ability.\n\nPymeteus is another one worth looking at - they do video-based assessments where candidates walk through their thinking on data problems. Kind of bridges that gap between technical skills and communication ability which is huge for analyst roles.\n\nOne approach that's worked well for people I know: use a two-stage technical screen. First a quick 15-20 min online assessment (SQL + basic data interpretation), then for the top 20-30 from that, do short async video responses to business case questions. You can review those way faster than live interviews.\n\nThe async video thing is key honestly - you can watch at 1.5x speed and get a sense for communication skills + thought process without the scheduling nightmare of 100 interviews.\n\nAt Promap we're actually exploring this exact workflow optimization problem for SMBs dealing with high-volume hiring - resume filtering, AI screening calls, AI assessment w/ locked screens to reduce likelihood of cheating.

We started doing casual physical verification during first calls, like asking someone to grab their coffee mug or adjust their laptop screen. Small stuff that feels natural but trips up the fakes.

It sets expectations and shows respect.\n\n2. Transparent communication :  I clearly outline interview stages, who they’ll meet, and what timelines look like. Clarity builds comfort.\n\n3. Timely updates : even if there’s no final decision yet, I drop a short note so candidates never feel ghosted.\n\n4. Personal touchpoints :  small check-ins before or after interviews make a huge difference in making the process feel human.\n\n5. Feedback and future connection :  I share constructive feedback whenever possible and re-engage strong candidates later.\n\nAI can help organize the process, but real connection and thoughtful follow-up are what turn a standard hiring journey into a memorable one.\n\nCandidate experience isn’t just about courtesy  it’s a quiet form of brand storytelling.

{"id": "lg4stmq", "text": "Yeah, AI for resume screening is getting pretty popular, especially when you're drowning in hundreds of resumes.I know how much it can save screening time because I work as an internal recruiter. Our process was a little disorganized when we initially started using it, but it soon became lot more efficient. It helped us focus on candidates who actually fit what we were looking for, which sped things up nicely.  \n  \nBut it's not just about speed - accuracy can be hit or miss depending on the tool. We had to keep tweaking our AI to make sure it wasn't overlooking good candidates. At first, it was tossing out resumes with unusual experience, even if they had the right skills. We fixed that with some adjustments.  \n  \nIf you're thinking about using AI, start small. We tried it out on a few roles first, got feedback, and made changes as we went. One big lesson: AI is great, but you still need that human touch. We always had someone review the AI-picked resumes to catch things the AI might miss.  \n  \nBottom line: AI can really help with resume screening and hiring faster, but keep an eye on how it's doing and adjust as needed. And definitely keep that human element in the final stages - it's key to not missing out on great candidates who might not fit the AI's exact criteria.

For many recruiters, saving time in the early screening steps is crucial. Here’s my perspective:\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n1. **Efficiency in Screening**: Passive screening is a smart approach for quickly narrowing down a large pool of candidates. By automating responses to standard questions, recruiters can get insights without the endless scheduling and calls.\n2. **Consistent Evaluation**: By asking the same questions, it ensures fairness and allows for easier comparison among candidates. This standardization can improve the objectivity of initial screenings.\n3. **Candidate Passion**: Video responses offer a chance to spot the candidates who truly stand out in terms of enthusiasm and communication skills—traits that may not always come through in a resume alone.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n\n1. **Tech Challenges**: There’s always a risk that tech hiccups, either on the candidate’s side or within the tool itself, could complicate the process. Ensuring it’s as user-friendly as possible will be essential.\n2. **Loss of Personal Touch**: While automation is efficient, it’s true that a real-time conversation sometimes reveals nuances that a video might not. For certain roles, this personal touch can still be valuable, so perhaps a hybrid approach would work best.\n\nAll in all, this sounds like a great tool for high-volume recruiting or for companies with limited hiring support.

{"id": "k1di6mi", "text": "* Mate, hats off to you for diving into the tech pool to make our lives a tad bit easier! Sourcing made easy :)  \nNow, here's my two cents about your innovation:  \nAbsolutely, I'd use it!  \n1. Time-saver: The idea of passive screening is like having a virtual assistant who does the initial legwork, saving us from the back-and-forth of scheduling calls. Basically, an extra pair of hands, which we all know is a recruiter's dream come true!  \n2. Consistency: Asking the same set of questions to all candidates? That's what we call a standardized format, making the comparison fair and square. It's a neat way to level the playing field and judge candidates on the same parameters.  \n3. Spotting the passionate ones: [Video interviews](https://recruitcrm.io/blogs/recruitcrm-exclusives/one-way-video-interviews/?utm_source=reddit+&amp;utm_medium=reddit+organic+syndication&amp;utm_campaign=011-+HIKquestions) and answers can be a window to gauge the candidate's enthusiasm and passion, which, sometimes, a resume fails to convey. It will probably feel like a mini 'meet the candidate' session before the actual interview.  \n**Why I might hesitate**  \n1. Tech hiccups: As much as technology is a boon, it comes with its own set of glitches. I'd be a bit wary about potential tech hiccups disrupting the smooth flow of the process.  \n2. Personal touch: While automation is great, I'd miss the personal touch and the spontaneous responses that a telephonic conversation brings to the table. It's those little nuances that sometimes help in making a decision.  \nAll in all, your tool sounds like a promising step towards bringing a fresh perspective to traditional methods, and I'm all for innovation and efficiency.  \nWould love to see how it shapes up!

{"id": "nt625m3", "text": "I’m not a recruiter, but I’ve been a hiring manager and just wrapped up a job search myself. So my favorite questions are more relevant in the HM interview context than in phone screen interview, but I love giving candidates a chance to both brag and vent, in a (mostly) unscripted manner. \n\nA question set in this vein that I was asked in one of my interviews was “if I were to gather the people you’ve worked with most closely throughout your career, what would they say is favorite/most enjoyable aspect of working with you?” Followed up with “what would they say is **your** favorite aspect of this type of work?” And finally he asked “what would they say is the thing that frustrates **you** the most?” \n\nI’ll be repurposing those questions in future interviews. One I always like to ask is “whats something you want me to know that I CANT discern from reading your resume?” and somewhat related, “can you tell about your proudest moment in your career? / most fulfilling moment?” \n\nI’m trying to get some personality out of them, to get a feel for it, which is maybe different than what recruiters are trying to achieve during their part of the process. But because they’ve been vetted by recruiters and usually another team member by the time I interview them, I’m pretty sure they can at least do the job from a competence POV, and I want to see what they’d be like to work with on a daily basis, how they think, and how they communicate their thoughts. So I try to focus my interviews in that direction. So when I ask these, I make sure to engage like a normal human having a conversation, and will ask follow up questions about whatever their answer is.

Most of my conversations start out with pleasantries and then maybe something that's not even work-related to kind of keep them off guard.

I'm letting the notetaker do all the recording and then I go back and fill in my data sheet and put together my interview summary for my clients. \n\nLast night is a good example. One of the guys on my team set up a three-way call between me, him, and a candidate that we were going to send out for a project management role for a construction company. After the call I hung up and then my teammate called me back and he said, \"Man, you make it look so easy. You got him to tell you everything and lots of times he just told you without you having to ask.\"\n\nAnd that's the key.

In my case it summarised a whole CV down to Name, Generic Job Title, Total Years of Experience, Top 3 Primary Skills (typically programming languages in my use case), and 3 x bullet points summarising their professional achievements. \n\nI also had another that would summarise a job posting into the key info I needed at a glance, and was also able to generate a fairly comprehensive boolean search I could copy, that would at least allow me to pull _probably relevant_ candidates from the ATS. \n\nI also had a play around with using it to suggest a list of skills / tags based on a CV, and outputting them as a comma separated list I could paste into the ATS\n\nWhat I ultimately realised is that the searching tools available in recruitment are actually pretty good - certainly good enough to get to a list you can (and should) be reviewing manually.

A better recommendation than “auto-withdraw” would be: if you dislike one-way video, ask for a phone screen as a reasonable adjustment. Many companies will do it. If they refuse any two-way conversation after a reasonable request then yes, that can be a culture signal and if it’s a deal breaker for the candidate obviously they are free to walk away.\n\nAlso, the dramatic “withdraw my application immediately” emails rarely achieve what people think.

This raises the question of legality. There are at least 81 legal statutes controlling the use of AI in HR or recruitment. You need to comply with the ones in your jurisdiction... and the penalties are heavy. NYC upto $1500 per transaction, and the EU can be over €30M.\nThe key aspects are:\n1) Transparency: \nThe algorithm must be transparent, and documented\nThe decision must be explained, and transparent.\n2) Candidate rights\nYou must inform the candidate of their data privacy rights.\nMost jurisdiction require you to give the right to withdraw\nMany jurisdictions demand that you give the candidate the right to update and elect to have a manual review.\n3) Auditability\nEvery decision must be documented. Not just what the decision was, but how it was made.\n4) Bias\nIn general it is not permissible to let AI select candidates by any protected characteristic in you jurisdiction. Usually sex and race are the minimum.\nBias neutrality in many jurisdictions must be regularly tested and results published.\n5) Human intervention: Many jurisdictions are not permitting entirely machine made decisions. This is also good practice if you know AI and are a recruiter. The AI can do the heavy lifting - but you can pick up nuances which are not obvious to a machine.\n\nThis is not meant to be a definitive list, or legal advice, but a quick insight into the minefield of recruitment AI. It is a 'high risk category' for most.\n\nThe laws governing this are being implemented right now. NYC and California are in place, the EU AI Act comes in early next year.

To be honest, I’m scratching the barrel here to add anything because your overview is already so comprehensive, but here are a few thoughts:\n\n1. Client Retention: I genuinely think this deserves its own category. It’s much easier (and more profitable) to win repeat business from existing clients than constantly chasing new ones. Agencies that focus on building strong, long-term partnerships and proactively upselling services often see the biggest gains in consistency and trust.\n\n2. Candidate Presentation: This is such a key part of the process, and agencies already spend a lot of time on it because it’s so critical. In a tough market, where good candidates are hard to find, the way they’re presented can make all the difference—not just in securing placements but also in how clients perceive the quality of your agency’s work. It’s almost a selling point in itself.\n\n3. Niche Activities: Your point about process categories made me think about how important it is for agencies to have their niche. Whether it’s managing payroll in contracting, handling compliance-heavy processes in sectors like healthcare, or sourcing hard-to-find skills in tech, having space for these sector-specific activities in your process makes a massive difference in standing out as a specialist.\n\nHonestly, you’ve nailed so much already—it’s exciting to see someone come in with this level of detail and thought.

The accuracy issue you're hitting is real because most of these tools are still fundamentally limited by the data they can access and how well they understand nuanced job requirements. LinkedIn's API restrictions, outdated contact info, and the fact that the best candidates often aren't actively broadcasting their availability means even the smartest AI is working with incomplete information. What I've found works better is accepting that you'll need 2-3 tools max, but being really strategic about which ones complement each other. Instead of chasing the perfect all-in-one solution, focus on tools that integrate well and cover different strengths like one for contact finding, another for boolean search optimization, maybe a third for engagement sequencing. The time you're spending jumping between tools usually gets offset by better quality results when each tool is doing what it actually does well.

This helps me quickly identify qualified candidates.  \n  \nI also use ***AI-powered sourcing tools*** to find candidates on social media platforms and job boards. These tools can analyze candidate profiles and suggest the best matches for a job, saving me time and effort in searching for potential candidates.  \n  \nAnother way I use ***AI is in the interview process***. AI-powered interview platforms can analyze candidates' facial expressions, body language, and speech patterns to provide insights into their suitability for a role.

{"id": "nygxzjy", "text": "So you will find interest, but you’ll need to fine tune and understand a few things to best scale it. \n\nPeople will pay to solve a problem and/or buy back time. Thats ultimately the baseline of your business. You are taking pride in it being handcrafted and non-automated. You’re not likely to get appreciation for that, certainly not to the level of time you’re committing to it. This limits your ability to add clients and revenue. This would be the major pivot. \n\nFrom a time perspective, myself and my recruiters probably spend 3 minutes on BD per outreach. This includes skim of the job req, date posted, company as well as dumping context info into an email. Then the email is loaded into our CRM with the ability to understand company hiring trends. I can easily see how many roles we’ve identified as targets for that company over any timeline and do generic reach out where warranted. Even if free,  ‘better info’ here doesn’t move the needle for me as a perm placement and retained-exclusive search firm. \n\nWhile there could be some saved time in the BD per opportunity, some of that time is education/familiarity and would need to be replaced on the back end. \n\nFor us as a single industry, boutique firm with ~40 placements per year, there’s not strong value, exclusive of cost. I do think there’s an avenue for success but feel even with a pivot, the challenge becomes finding the sweet spot - companies big enough to be willing to invest and small enough that’s there’s not an internal solution.

I’ll stick to the recruitment bits as an ex in-house recruiter.\n\nI agree job hunting is exhausting, especially in an employer-driven market like we’re in now. But you’re not doing anyone, especially yourself, any favours by refusing to play the game.\n\nA lot of interviews are basically a social ritual. “Why do you want to work here?” is rarely a deep question. It’s a signal check: can you communicate like a normal person, show basic intent, and handle a bit of workplace theatre without turning it into a battle of principles. If you refuse to play this game, it often gets read as rigid, combative, or hard to manage, even if you’re brilliant at the actual job.\n\nAlso, most in-house recruiters are not trying to be liked. They’re trying to run an efficient, defensible process and be credible with hiring managers. Candidate experience matters, but it’s not the primary KPI. So expecting the whole system to become radically more direct and accountable because it “should” be is setting yourself up for disappointment.\n\nPractical advice: treat the performative parts as a script, give concise answers that make you easy to say yes to, and come up with some questions to ask at the end to show you’re engaged even if you already know the likely answers.

{"id": "h1c0vhu", "text": "Thanks for the advice and tips. Some good takeaways there. I thought about condensing two of our interview stages into one. To do this I would want 2 hours with the candidate. At the minute we have a 30minute screen, 1 hour 1st stage, 1.5 hour 2nd stage and a 1 hour final. That is 4 hours with the candidate. I feel that is decent and could be more. If I lessened the stages to 3 I would want 30mins intro/screening, 2 hours hiring manager+team member and 1 hour final stage CEO/MD. During this we would always have some sort of task-related interview to see how they perform 'on the job' and it is always job-related. I hate general competency based interviews!

{"id": "lg01oii", "text": "Happy to help with your master’s thesis on AI in recruitment! Here’s a general breakdown of the recruitment stages and how AI is currently integrated into them:  \n  \n**1. Stages of Recruitment:**  \n  \n- Job Posting and Sourcing: This is where recruiters advertise job openings and source potential candidates. AI tools can help by targeting job ads to the right audience and sourcing candidates from various platforms.  \n  \n- Preselection: AI is heavily used here. Tools like **Recruit CRM** and LinkedIn Talent Solutions scan and filter resumes based on keywords, skills, and experience. This stage narrows down the candidate pool to those who best match the job requirements.  \n  \n- Phone/Video Interview: AI can assist in scheduling interviews and even analyzing video interviews through tools like HireVue, which assess candidates' non-verbal cues, tone, and language.  \n  \n- Physical Interview: This is more traditional and involves face-to-face interactions. AI might play a minimal role here, often limited to scheduling and feedback collection.  \n  \n- Final Decision: AI tools help by ranking candidates based on data collected throughout the recruitment process, aiding recruiters in making more informed decisions.  \n  \n**2. AI Tools in Recruitment:**  \n  \nSome commonly used AI tools include HireVue, Recruit CRM, Lever, and LinkedIn Talent Solutions. These tools often integrate AI features for resume parsing, candidate matching, and interview analysis.  \n  \n**3. Stages Where AI is Used:**  \n  \nAI is most commonly used in the preselection stage. It scans resumes for keywords and skills, making it easier to shortlist candidates who fit the job description. During the interview stage, AI can analyze responses and body language in video interviews to provide additional insights.  \n  \n**4. Flaws and Preferences:**  \n  \nOne observed flaw is that AI tools might miss out on great candidates who don’t use the exact keywords the system looks for, leading to a potential bias. Some recruiters prefer traditional methods for their personalized touch and deeper understanding of candidates, while others appreciate the efficiency and scalability of AI tools.  \n  \n**5. Personal Experience:**  \n  \nI have been in recruitment for eight years, working with both small firms and larger corporations. AI tools have definitely helped us in various steps, but the human element remains a must in making final hiring decisions.  \n  \nI hope this helps with your thesis!

These platforms are easy to learn, quick to set up, and much more cost-effective than systems aimed at larger teams.\n\nThe real value often comes from tailoring the system so it fits your unique workflow, even as your business evolves. With the support of an AI solutions partner, you can set up custom automations and integrations specific to your recruitment process, making it easier to stay organized and responsive without additional software bloat.\n\nIf you would like to explore how to create a lean, scalable CRM and automation setup to efficiently move beyond Excel, I am always available for a friendly introduction call.

{"id": "nl54h8r", "text": "I don’t have a direct answer to your question about building a tool, but I do want to offer some perspective. Spending 5 hours a day sourcing on LinkedIn might sound excessive at first glance, but it really depends on what that time includes. If it’s purely running searches, yes — that’s likely inefficient. But if it includes market research, iterating on search logic, investigating companies, identifying networking targets, reviewing profiles, refining keywords, and adjusting strategy based on what you're finding — then that time investment starts to make sense.\n\nAI screening can absolutely save time, but only if you're feeding it the right context and investing in teaching it what “fit” looks like for your roles. Without that, you risk sacrificing quality for speed.\n\nAlso, I’d suggest expanding sourcing beyond LinkedIn. Platforms like GitHub, Crunchbase, technical blogs, and even niche communities can offer richer signals.

Tried to force-fit a big-name sales CRM first (won't name names but rhymes with \"Schmalesforce\") and it was a nightmare—so much admin for stuff I didn't need.\n\nWhat actually stuck was using a simpler, flexible CRM that lets me treat a \"search\" as a central project/deal, and attach multiple contacts (CEO, Chair, investor) to it cleanly. I use Pipedrive now. It's not perfect, but it’s fast and visual, which kept me using it. The timeline view for each person is clutch for seeing past interactions across different companies.\n\nBiggest lesson: don't over-engineer early. You just need to log emails/meetings (Outlook sync is fine) and see the web of relationships. Anything that makes you hesitate to log a quick note is a killer.\n\nWeirdly, the thing that moved the needle most for my *candidate* outreach—which is the other half of the puzzle—was using GoPerfect. I know you said you care more about visibility than automation, but for me, sourcing was eating time. This handled the LinkedIn/email side for candidate pipelining so I could focus on the client relationships in my CRM. Just a workflow thing that worked.\n\nTBH, scalability worry is real.

The people who did already know how to do things may have to adapt some of their strategies now since certain areas become more crowded (candidates have a lot more noise, etc.) and because many tools have changed (search continues to evolve). \n* **There is still big opportunity for sourcers.** I'll give a direct example - last year at my company I had the highest pass-through rate for technical screens and also for onsite interviews. I became the filter that saved the company tens of thousands of dollars in interviewer time, and made for a much more enjoyable process for interviewers, hiring managers, and candidates. Do all companies value this? No, not really... many just want to see X number of hires or time to fill. Some leading TA teams definitely do see and appreciate this human factor, though, and AI is nowhere near being able to make the right recommendations when it comes to talent tollgates and recruiter screening stages. \n* **If I were a sourcer, I would try to expand my full lifecycle capabilities (I already am a Full Lifecycle Recruiter).** Because of some of the things I mentioned earlier, I think it is important for sourcers to also lean into other areas such as stakeholder management, candidate closing, etc. - since those areas are not being targeted quite as much for AI replacement. \n\nI see this AI revolution as somewhat similar to the shift in the early 2000's when things pivoted from phone to email. Recruiters who were good on the phone (or even with leaving voicemails) needed to adapt and figure out how to engage talent via email, or via platforms like LinkedIn. Some were fine, and others were not as adaptable. \n\nRecruiters/Sourcers who can still use some of the AI tools where they make sense, while adding human value beyond the tools, can still have good job stability and impact. It is a tough time to be a recruiter/sourcer, though.", "timestamp": "2025-10-23T15:31:58Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "What Does the Future Hold for Talent Sourcers in the Age of AI?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Recruitment/comments/1oe4j9n/what_does_the_future_hold_for_talent_sourcers_in/"}}

{"id": "nl509cr", "text": "Those are great points. \n\nI think that like you, my true 'superpower' is likely more on the sourcing and talent engagement side (I am good at other things, but many other people are also good at those same things). Companies with a solid employer brand can attract viable talent, good hiring managers can help to 'sell' roles, and strong compensation and leveling makes it easier to close roles. Where TA professionals can have the biggest impact is identifying who actually goes through that process - identifying and engaging the best of the best, and ensuring a smooth process for them. \n\nThe reason I suggested FLC is more for 'protective' reasons, since Sourcing is something that is more 'under attack' by AI and TA leaders, and it is less common to find a TA leader who understands a lot of the nuance. In fact, I have worked at a few places where senior leaders didn't understand the difference in difficulty in recruiting a Full Stack SWE versus a MLE. Or even how much harder it is to find a Staff/Principal Engineer versus early or mid-level hires. However, I have also worked with TA leaders who 'get it'. \n\nHaving used a number of different AI tools, including agentic sourcing solutions, I would say that there are certainly some accelerators out there... but also some things that are far less efficient or effective than a good sourcer. \n\nIt is also tough to quantify or identify a slightly better hire. Many recruiters will go with the minimum viable candidate (the candidate who can barely clear) since it is much easier on many fronts - easier to find, easier to engage, and easier to close. Some of those hires do end up being good, so it is not completely flawed, but without strong governance you could end up with a company that fails to elevate their talent or becomes more mediocre.", "timestamp": "2025-10-24T14:06:08Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "What Does the Future Hold for Talent Sourcers in the Age of AI?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Recruitment/comments/1oe4j9n/what_does_the_future_hold_for_talent_sourcers_in/"}}

I work on Middle management to C-Suite (Agency founder) - And most of candidates we work with would not see AI via a first contact being a good thing (So far). I also, have not find any tools that is so far good enough to do a proper selection of candidates. \n   * I do think AI is good to give you contacts details for you not to scroll plenty google pages, it is good to help summarise a JD if you want to give a frame to the candidate via email/LinkedIn, it is good to find similar companies, it is good to build a Boolean search. \n   * I think it might \"replace\" or change the process for high volume / High turnover / Low skills roles where the first steps will happen via/with an AI. You will have a real financial interest.\n   * I.E - I was at LinkedIn connect last week and their Keynote for their LinkedIn Assistant... Outside of their tools to rephrase an InMail, they were selling that LinkedIn Assistant was an amazing sourcer. I have played with it, and regardless the Prompt I have used, played with, it has never beaten my boolean and by far!  \n* How are you adapting your skills or workflows to stay relevant?\n   * I think the best adaptation would be how today AI can help you out to make your life easier, help you get better result.

(For me presentation is something that is really great as I am usually slow to build a presentation).\n   * I keep in touch to see the last updates, just to make sure you follow the evolution. You want to see if that can be beneficial for you. I spent quite some time there, just to keep up.\n   * AI can do a lot of interesting things, and staying in touch with it is important, you don't want to end up like our grand parents who never got along mobile phone because they were happy with what they had and did not want to change. \n* What new capabilities or mindsets do you think will define the next generation of sourcing professionals?\n   * The same mindset than the best sourcer I have met: Always be curious, always wonder how you can find and attract the people cannot. That pushed them to find new tools, new optimisation and be curious about AI and how they can use it at their advantage. \n\nMy thoughts, are that I do not believe at all AI will fully replace Sourcer, Recruiter - It might reduce the FTE for certain jobs/Market.

{"id": "njtses7", "text": "Most lead gen agencies selling to recruiters are full of shit and will waste your money. The ones promising \"new clients every month\" are overselling because they can't control whether those leads actually have open roles or budgets to hire.\n\nOur clients who run recruitment agencies found that lead gen works sometimes but the ROI is usually terrible. You're paying $3k to $5k monthly to get meetings with companies who might have a hiring need in 6 months. Recruitment is relationship-based and transactional when someone needs to fill a role now, not something you can force through cold outreach.\n\nThe agencies that got zero placements probably brought meetings with companies that weren't actively hiring or didn't have budget approved. A qualified lead for recruitment isn't just \"talks to HR managers,\" it's \"company actively hiring for roles you specialize in with budget and urgency.\" Most lead gen agencies can't filter for that.\n\nThe ones who saw success probably got lucky with timing or the agency understood recruitment sales cycles well enough to target companies actually hiring. That's rare. Most just blast cold emails to anyone with a VP of Sales title and call it qualified leads.\n\nWhat makes a decent lead gen agency different is they actually understand your niche. For SaaS sales recruitment specifically, they should be targeting high growth SaaS companies that just raised funding or are scaling fast. Generic \"we reach HR people\" agencies won't work because they don't filter for companies with active hiring plans.\n\nRed flags to watch for are guarantees of X meetings per month without qualifying what those meetings actually mean, charging big upfront fees before proving results, and cookie cutter pitches that don't show they understand recruitment sales at all.\n\nBetter approach is hire a part time SDR who focuses only on your recruitment firm for like $2k monthly. They'll be way more invested in quality over quantity than an agency juggling 20 clients. You can train them on exactly what a qualified lead looks like for you.\n\nAlternatively, just invest that $3k to $5k into your own outreach infrastructure. Buy Apollo or ZoomInfo, set up proper cold email domains, and do it yourself or have one of your three team members own it. At least then you control quality and messaging.\n\nFor recruitment specifically, referrals and building relationships with hiring managers at target companies works way better long term than paying for cold leads. One happy client who keeps coming back with roles is worth more than 50 cold meetings that go nowhere.\n\nIf you're gonna test a lead gen agency, negotiate performance-based pricing. Pay per qualified meeting or per placement, not flat monthly retainers. If they're confident in results they should be willing to tie compensation to outcomes. Most won't because they know their leads are garbage.\n\nThe harsh reality is recruitment doesn't need fancy lead gen, it needs hustle and relationships. If your team isn't already maxing out their own outreach capacity, paying an agency is just outsourcing work you should be doing yourselves to learn what actually works in your market.", "timestamp": "2025-10-16T17:15:32Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "Thinking about hiring a lead gen agency for my recruitment firm…", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Recruitment/comments/1o8153b/thinking_about_hiring_a_lead_gen_agency_for_my/"}}

Also use this code (and tell Mikel I sent you) to get 5% of lifetime of your subscription. 5S25CXO\n\n1. sending linkedin connection requests. It does them in bulk and with operators so you can personalize it. \n2. Sourcing Linkedin (Recruiter/Nav/OG LinkedIn) because the chrome extension will grab the entire search with one click. I can search for every Project manager in Tennessee that works for XYZ co and with one click it will put every single one in jobin. Even if it is 8 pages of 400 profiles. The Chrome extension will even grab linkedin profiles and put them in jobin off any HTML web page. For example find a company that has \"About Us\" Page with 40 people and their linkedin URL is in their bio or below their name. The Chrome extension will grab them all and put them into jobin. \n3. I have not fully embraved it but the sequencing section. You can use a linkedin connection as a step in the sequence AND it has a \"if then\" component. For example if they accept you connection you can send a follow up message, follow up email or end the sequence. If they do not accept in say 48 hours you can send an email or withdrawal the connection. Lots of different ways to set it up. They said they are adding SMS to it this year and possibly click to call. \n4. Speaking of withdrawing conections. Having too many outstanding connection requests is not good. LI will smack your pee pee and put you in linkedin jail. You can do bulk linkedin connection requests withdrawals by time or numbers. \n5. For those that have the maxed out number of 1st degree connections and you want to get rid of old/useless you can bulk remove first degree connections too.", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T15:22:19Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "InMail vs LI Message  to a 1st Contact", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Recruitment/comments/1iiqpyq/inmail_vs_li_message_to_a_1st_contact/"}}

From what you’ve described, $500/month per role as a retainer is very reasonable for small clients, especially since you’re handling sourcing, screening, and interviews.\n\nHere’s how we’d approach it strategically:\n\nPackage it as a “Recruitment-as-a-Service” model — position it as an ongoing hiring partnership, not just task execution.\n\nOffer tiers — for example: $400 for basic sourcing + shortlisting, $600–$700 for full screening and interviews.\n\nAutomate the grunt work (Indeed/LinkedIn posting, Zapier/Trello workflows) so your time is spent only on high-value tasks — interviewing and shortlisting.\n\nOver time, add performance bonuses (like $100–$200 per successful hire) once trust builds.\n\nDocument your process — so later, you can onboard junior VAs and scale this into a micro-agency model.\n\n\nWe’d say start with the $500 flat fee to re-engage your old client, prove the value again, and then expand into retainers for similar clients.

{"id": "kdqndgz", "text": "TLDR: don’t automate if your content is bad (resulting in low response rates) \n\nWhat you’re asking for is software to spray and pray, that will only result in lower engagement, poor funnel metrics, bad reputation and pissed off candidates. \n\nWhat I highly advise is you work on your outreach content to get response rates up. \nAutomation only works when the original process works, and if you’re getting anything lower then 15-20% response rate then your outreach is what needs work. \n\nAdditional point, if you’re contracting in house (going by your flair here) then your client won’t like you mass messaging candidates via a bad automated process for their company - not if they care about their EVP. With the market the way it is right now, you want high response rates and good conversion rates to keep your contract running with them. \n\nThings I would advise, research outreach templates online, there’s many that work, but you want candidates to not think it’s an automated spray and pray message. Be personable and give them the time they deserve - they’re not just candidates, they’re people and a lot can smell a low effort automated message a mile away. \n\nSourcewhale is also a great tool for nurture campaigns and also has content coach, which can help you curate your outreach and get higher engagement if the above doesn’t help you. \nNurture campaigns statistically result in higher numbers of placements compared to one and done LinkedIn messages etc.", "timestamp": "2023-12-17T10:56:38Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "Software for automated reachout", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Recruitment/comments/18kehzd/software_for_automated_reachout/"}}

{"id": "nqqm0sz", "text": "A lot of recruiters think standing out means flashy messages, but honestly the stuff that makes candidates remember you is simple and human:\n\n• Personalize beyond the resume - Not just “I saw you worked at X.” More like referencing something they posted, a project they shared, or even acknowledging a career pivot they’re trying to make. It shows you actually looked at them.\n\n• Set expectations clearly (and early) - A quick “Here’s the real timeline and what I’ll update you on” message does more for trust than any templated email. Most recruiters say they’ll stay in touch… few actually do.\n\n• Own the uncomfortable updates - Ghosting is what makes candidates jaded. Even a 10-second update like “No news yet, but you’re still in the mix” gets you remembered as someone who respects their time.\n\n• Prep them for interviews like you actually want them to win - Share themes the team cares about, common pitfalls, or what hiring managers value. Candidates feel the difference immediately.\n\n• Follow up after rejection with something genuinely useful - A short piece of feedback, a resource, or even another role they’re a fit for.

{"id": "nqosk4w", "text": "Simple question: what would make you remember a recruiter and go back to them years later if you were hiring or looking for something new? First thing I’d do is that. \n\nBit cliché, but there’s only one ‘you’. Whatever unique qualities you have or things you personally feel are important, use them and translate it into your work. Not gonna click with everyone, but anyone who stands out in this world has love and hate. Find your people.\n\nSinging your praises. There’s a common theme with people at the top in their corporate roles, and it’s that they love to blow smoke up the back of themselves. Any time something goes well, they make their involvement be known to the important decision makers. 90% of recruiters don’t make a big deal out of the new hire they just made for a company. Add a process to let a few people know, within your clients company, that you just made a big gap for them disappear. Announce to department heads and to HR, and throw something up on LinkedIn as well, tagging the company and hiring manager. Make them all feel important with it and give them some good exposure. That notification could turn into another job order. Also, track that candidates progress - if they get a promotion - “hey mr/mrs hiring manager looks like Bobs doing well, how are your hiring plans looking? Need another Bob?”\n\nSpeaking of LinkedIn - content (eurgh). It really is a cesspit for “look at me”, and I personally do as much as I possibly can to avoid it, but in all honesty it’s probably the number one marketing tool for recruiters right now, and if you want to stand out or have old clients remember you, then this is a sure fire way to stay front of mind. It’s like replacing your check in emails by showing what you’re doing for everyone else. A lot of people share facebooky mum posts, like “me and stevie went to see some dolphins today and this is what it taught me about business” - don’t do that. You don’t have to post every day, 1-2 times a week is enough. Talk about real problems and how you’ve solved them. Talk about real insights, up to date market news and for goodness sake, please write it yourself. Write a little piece and ask yourself - “is this providing any value”, if the answers yes, even just a little bit, then post it. Track the engagement, but don’t worry about it. If it’s just you and your mum liking the post, it does not matter. It’s about impressions and the right people just seeing you’re active, not that you’re the prom king for LinkedIn. \n\nAlso, don’t knock the basics (99% of recruiters definitely aren’t “fine”). One way of standing out and impressing in this space is just being consistent and running the basics. It will shock you the amount of people who don’t. We may all have the same templates and follow the same process, but some of us are far more diligent at staying consistent with it and actually getting it done. If you look at the things candidates always moan about “they ghosted me”, “they didn’t give an update”, “radio silence” - do the opposite and be transparent, even if it’s difficult news. Clients complain about “they shared a candidate we couldn’t have”, “we’re wasting time on people who aren’t relevant/too expensive/wont relocate” - do the opposite, make sure candidates are spot on, one hit wonders aren’t an accident, you found exactly what they need. Stick to the process. We all send the same crap for a reason. It works. \n\nLast thing I’d say is, if you want to make the job less boring, then find a way to make YOURSELF enjoy it more. It sounds like you’re hitting a bit of groundhog day (7 year itch is a thing, look it up), so just give yourself a reset and realign your goals to get the energy back up. Aside from money, what are you trying to get out of this. Find a way to make the calls more enjoyable. Have a simple objective in each call, like finding out one new thing from a candidate/client about their life (unless it’s about their sodding kids - WE DONT CARE! Haha).\n\nHope this helps, even just a little bit!", "timestamp": "2025-11-25T11:32:18Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "Recruiters who actually stand out.

{"id": "nqon0uv", "text": "Honestly, don't overcomplicate things. You just need to browse a few recruitment related forums on here to realize that a whole lot of recruiters aren't even doing the basics. Be professional, overcommunicate. \n\nMaybe I'm assuming the basics here but for example, one of the first things we learned was proper questioning techniques to genuinely understand the candidates experiences, while also understanding the why at a pretty deep level. Get that full understanding of past and desired future, document it and always tie everything back to it in your interactions. People will feel heard and understood because they have been. We also learned about objection handling techniques to again fully understand what a person is objecting and why... And ideally to work towards an outcome. Was utilized a lot more on client side interactions and new business development but can also add value when you're advancing through a process with a candidate and things come up.\n\nWant to really go above and beyond? Knockup some infographics or some articles that talk about your niche. Specifically things that are useful to candidates. Don't try and talk like you're a CTO if you do Tech recruiting, talk about the recruiting, hiring, career, job search perspective since that's what you know. This builds credibility and shows you genuinely care about the candidates in the niche you're in vs turning up when there's a fee attached.

{"id": "nqvnzza", "text": "I sense a lot of the responses here aren't being honest. \n\nI supply mainly blue collar temporary construction staff. We're a small operation that punch above our weight. We're lucky that 80% of the roles we supply are long term placements (5 months +). In order to get that cream though the remaining 20% probably takes up 50% of our time. Not complaining!\n\nI'd love to constantly give constructive feedback and I feel guilty that I can't. But these are the issues.\n\n1. Not enough hours in the day. When your applicant to appointment conversion rate is in the region of 5-10% you barely have time to call through all applicants.\n\n2. People don't like being told they aren't good enough. Especially trades people.\n\n3. Some clients are wankers. In our field we get the call often as a last resort. They'll tell you you're the only call they've made on it, you'll spend all day on getting someone only to be ignored at the end of the day. (Luckily not often).\n\n4. Reputation. I've had all sorts of scenarios with unsuccessful applicants. Having threats and being shouted at are the least worrying things. People love to leave bad reviews online. To a small company like ours that can cripple us.\n\nI believe you have to make peace with the amount of dishonesty you put out. Even with you guys working in the perm white collar sector. You may think you're dishing out the gospel. But be real, at least with yourselves.\n\nBeing standout and being honest aren't exclusive. I do my best to let people down gently. You can do that dishonestly and compassionately. \n\nI think setting your stall out from the first 30 seconds of a conversation is key 'if you don't hear from me, chances are I've gone with another option',' I'll be honest I've had a lot of interest for this' or 'this is shit work mate, it's not for everyone'. \n\nI liked the comment from someone earlier about 'warts n'all'. When discussing roles be honest+. Make it sound worse than it is because when they get there and find out its not as bad, you look a legend.

Then it hits the client-side bottleneck and dies a slow, silent death while the hiring manager “just needs a few more days.” Then they panic when the candidate signs elsewhere. \n\nWhat helps? Three things:\n\n1. Scorecards and SLAs.  Set the tone upfront. “If we commit to quality, you commit to process.” Timelines aren’t optional.\n2. Pre-close the manager, not just the candidate. Show them real-life examples of losing talent by dragging their heels. A few horror stories tend to sharpen the focus.\n3. Create FOMO. Market updates, real salary data, competitor hires. Remind them there’s a game happening and they’re not the only ones playing.\n\nAlso, looping them in early only works if they’re emotionally invested.

{"id": "nyn22ri", "text": "In my experience, this usually isn’t a motivation or awareness issue. It’s a process issue. Everything moves fast until the role hits a point where the system depends on a human remembering to take the next step, and that’s where things stall.\n\nWhen candidates sit with a hiring manager for days or weeks, it’s rarely because the HM doesn’t care. Most are juggling their actual job, inbox overload, meetings, and approvals. If the workflow relies on manual follow ups, urgency fades really quickly.\n\nFull transparency, I work at Workable and spend a lot of time looking at these exact bottlenecks across teams. What we see over and over is that recruiters end up acting like full time naggers because there’s nothing in the process enforcing momentum.\n\nA couple things that have helped in practice:\n\nAutomated accountability instead of personal chasing. When the system flags a 48 or 72 hour delay, it takes the pressure off the recruiter and keeps things moving without awkward follow ups.\n\nLow friction feedback. If feedback means logging into a separate tool and writing paragraphs, it won’t happen.

Early alignment on timelines, feedback SLAs, and decision ownership makes a huge difference. \n\nSo honestly my gut check question for you and others here: are hiring managers mostly operating out of email or shared spreadsheets?

I ask more behavioral questions, give interviews a bit more time, and do a quick tech check upfront so I’m not subconsciously judging someone’s Wi-Fi or mic.\n\nHonestly, the bigger issue I see now is candidates not prepping for video interviews at all: bad lighting, messy backgrounds, staring at the screen instead of the camera.
