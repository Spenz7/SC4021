If you are a black woman, and you know about this rule, when a job offer comes in, you will always have the thought in the back of your head that they don’t want you for your excellence in their field, but rather your identity. \n\nAnother problem is that this would require mass migration and around the country. Most people don’t have the money to just up and move, and most businesses don’t pay for relocation. Barring a government funded relocation program, you are adding a cost to the workers. That’s never going to work.\n\nThe other commonly cited problem is that often times, people like where they live, and simply don’t want to move. They may have roots in the community, they may have family there, they may have young kids in school, and don’t want to take them away from their friends. Some people prefer cities to the country, and vice versa.\n\nYou’d have places where people who already live there can’t find a job because companies have to essentially import people from across the country to fill a quota.

What the hell do the vast majority of people in Jackson do when a company has to fire a bunch of black workers, and import in a ton of white workers, to meet the quota? Do they move to Bismarck, to then make up the 12% at a company there? \n\nIt’s a nice sounding plan, but it’s not the answer for the hiring discrimination that is a problem in the US.
