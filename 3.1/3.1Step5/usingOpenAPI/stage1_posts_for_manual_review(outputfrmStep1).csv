Been digging deep into recruiting automation software lately, especially the “AI everything” wave. But most tools feel like vaporware or barely handle volume.

If you're processing dozens or hundreds of candidates/month, have you actually cut hiring costs or time-to-fill with AI tools? What’s been the ROI?

Tools I’m curious about:
- Interview AI
- screening AI
- AI interview scheduling
- ATS automation (we're using Bullhorn, so looking for something that integrates)

On one hand, the idea of saving time and getting warm intros to people who are actively looking and aligned with our stage sounds appealing. On the other hand, I’m skeptical about whether these tools actually deliver on quality or if it’s just a glorified sourcing bot with some clever packaging.

AI,recruitment,1jx1j5y,Realtime AI assistant for interviewers?,"Hi there. After a long pause, my company started hiring today, and I did 3 interviews. While interviewing, I came up with an idea to have an AI assistant that listens to both me and the candidate, helping me ask the right questions. My problem is that I often forget to cover all the questions I plan to ask. Or sometimes I need to dig deeper and ask follow-ups but again, I forget.

So I'm wondering, does anyone else experience similar issues? I have a tech background, so I'm considering creating an AI app that would simply sit on a phone, listen to the interview, interpret it, and proactively suggest what to ask next in real-time. I don't want any integration with dinosaur ATS systems etc., just a standalone app that listens and proactively assists. It could also generate summaries afterward, but that's secondary.

AI,humanresources,1nnlnw7,Need your opinion: Company wants AI to run first interviews and I’m uneasy about it [CO],"My company is seriously considering rolling out an AI interview tool to handle the first screening with candidates. The pitch is that it will shorten hiring time and make the process more efficient. Everyone around me seems excited about the idea… but I can’t shake the feeling that something important is being lost.

I keep putting myself in the candidate’s shoes. If I were applying for a job and my very first “conversation” was with a bot, I’d feel like I wasn’t valued as a person from the start. I believe that first interaction sets the tone, it’s where you get a sense of the company’s culture, the energy of the team, and the subtle cues that don’t show up in a resume. An algorithm can score answers, but it can’t build rapport, pick up on personality, or make someone feel welcome.

Leadership argues that AI will cut hiring time, but to me it risks sending the message that people are just data points. I know efficiency matters, but part of me believes hiring should stay human, even if it takes more time.

Am I being too moralistic here, or does anyone else feel uneasy about letting AI handle the very first conversation with a candidate?

AI,recruitinghell,1my56ks,"I didn't get a job because I was profiled as a ""Video Gamer""","I was interviewed for a Afterschool Drama Teacher program at the local museum here. This was a virtual interview so I get the Google Meet email. When I joined, I notice that there was another in the room with us but it was an AI that was going to transcribe the meeting called Otter.AI. I didn't think much of it, I figure that this was protocol, whatever. 

Interview goes on, I feel good despite the little red flags I saw come up. But I need work and being lucky enough to get an interview in my field of choice, I hoped for the best. About 30 minutes after the interview concluded I get another email from Otter AI that shares what was transcribed. I felt like I wasn't suppose to see this but I decided hey, if anything I can go over the interview for myself and just take it as a healthy moment to critique myself. 

Little did I realize, the transcription continues after I left. 

I've attached what was said but, I was profiled as a ""video gamer"" and that was why I was not qualified for the job. 

At first I was pissed but then I had to laugh at the absurdity of it all. If that's their thought process, perhaps I dodged one big ol bullet! 

For transparency, yes I do play video games. But I have a professional resume filled with Teaching experience, industry and professional work under my belt.

AI,recruitinghell,1o6cglm,Tldr; an undisclosed AI keyword scored my interview in real time,"Rant: 
One of the interviews I had recently was a job I was extremely overqualified for both in salary and in experience. But it was with a video game company so I applied anyway as that's a tough industry to break into. 

The interviewer (the Chief of Staff) started by being like ""this isn't a typical interview, tell us about yourself outside of work. This is a vibe check"" and then asked me just about that stuff and two questions like ""what do we do"". Extremely entry level questions. 

She didn't ask me a single thing about my background, experience, or resume. Only about myself explicitly ""outside of work"" and the 2 very junior questions about them.

At the end of the interview, when I asked if she has any concerns about my resume or our conversation she explained that she has NO INPUT on if I move forward. The Chief of Staff. Instead, an AI that has been recording our conversation is scoring me and that is what determines if I move forward. 

In an interview about my HOBBIES. 

Allegedly this was to ""remove bias"" (because AI is famously unbiased lol). And suddenly the interview made more sense. She didn't ask me about my work background because she probably didn't know it--an AI moved me forward. She didn't seem to know anything about me. 

If I had known an AI was scoring me, I would have done my interview entirely differently. Instead of trying to create a connection and establish rapport with the interviewer, I would have adjusted to speaking more about my work experience and background even when it was ostensibly not the purpose of the call. 

The whole thing was so icky and insulting (from the condescending entry level questions to telling me at the end that my conversation with her had no meaning unless the AI likes me) that I laughed when I got the rejection. 

Apparently I didn't ""vibe"" hard enough with the computer 🤷🏻‍♀️

Edit: addressing a few things quickly since this post BLEW up (it's literally my first reddit post and I was unprepared 😅). 
1. The title seems to confuse everyone so apologies, it's not an ""AI keyword"" it's that AI ""keyword-scored"" my interview. Admittedly an assumption on my part, but meaning that I imagine the AI was looking for certain keywords and scoring me based on my use of them. 
2. Still looking for a job and nervous at the amount of attention this post is getting so I won't name the company (yet, maybe after I get a job). But it wasn't a video game studio, it was an agency that helps video game studios advertise to influencers. So, in the industry, not directly working on video games.

AI,recruitinghell,1nw105v,Unpopular opinion: I miss the days pre-AI as a recruiter,"I might get downvoted for this. But as a recruiter, things honestly felt better before AI took over everything, RE: iresumes, portfolios, emails, messages (!!!)

Back then, I could actually see someone’s individuality in their portfolio, their writing, and their emails. I would get a sense of their skills, but also their personality. Now everything feels copy pasted: same tone, same phrases, the same “perfect” wording. Half the time I can’t even tell if I’m talking to a real person or just reading a polished AI draft. I could smell ChatGPT from a mile away. 

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not anti-AI. I utilize ChatGPT, Gemini, all that good stuff, JamieAI for things like transcribing interviews. I even came across WorkBeaver AI that literally performs tasks from the description that was given. A lot of good and convenience has come out of AI.

But here’s the thing - I wish candidates used AI responsibly. Lean on it for structure or clarity, sure, but not to the point where everyone sounds identical. I’d rather read something imperfect but authentic than another templated wall of text that could’ve come from anyone.

Recruiting is already tough. AI just made it harder to spot the real standouts. 

 Unsolicited advice to people applying for jobs: Don't use a generic AI template in your emails/CVs. It automatically gets filtered in our brains 98% off the time.

AI,recruitinghell,1lg7oc5,PSA to candidates using AI in interviews: You’ve gotta try a little harder.,"I’ve seen this more and more over the past year...candidates clearly relying on AI during live interviews. And while I get it, AI isn’t going anywhere and it is used for resumes and cover letters. But using it mid-interview without finesse is becoming a deal-breaker.

If you're staring at the screen, repeating the question out loud, pausing awkwardly, and then delivering a robotic-sounding response like you're reading it off ChatGPT... it’s a no from us.

If you’re going to use AI tools to help prep, great. But once you’re in the actual interview, you need to sound like you and not like you’re reading a script in real time. It’s painfully obvious, and it makes us question your actual understanding and communication skills.

Just my two cents from the other side of the screen. 

EDIT: This post is not about discriminating against people who are neurodivergent or have autism. 
This is about being asked an interview question about your field of expertise and answering with a generic nonspecific response that does not answer the  question at all.

# Exploring what organizations should know about using AI in Recruitment &amp; Talent Acquisition efforts 

Artificial Intelligence (AI) in business is increasingly becoming a focal point as organizations strive to enhance and streamline their workforce operations. As we delve into the realms of AI, it’s crucial to address a common gap in understanding what AI truly encompasses. This blog seeks to unravel the complexities surrounding AI, distinguishing between concepts like process automation and predictive analytics and generative AI, such as ChatGPT. As we explore the nuances of AI applications, including the emergent field of Prompt Engineering and the intricacies of AI training, we’ll also scrutinize the ethical and legal ramifications of AI-generated content and data usage. By dissecting these multifaceted issues, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of AI’s role in business and its broader implications.

AI in business is a growing trend, especially as many organizations look to optimize and augment their workforce. However, I think it’s important to mention that many organizations do not understand what AI is. The term has been thrown around to include process automation, predictive/advanced analytics, and generative AI (ChatGPT). These misunderstandings often conflate the topic; for example, within generative AI, many people confuse training with AI chat prompt manipulation. Prompt manipulation is absolutely something useful in leveraging AI, hence the emergence of the “Prompt Engineering” job. However, training is where many advancements are happening. It’s also important to know where data comes from, who owns it, and how it is being used in training. It is extremely important to the resulting impacts of how we work with AI and how organizations leverage it. For example, when [Amazon tried to create an AI recruiting tool](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1MK0AG/), it resulted in unintentional bias. Most likely propagated by implicit bias in their training data and model-building methods. Another issue is ownership not only of the data but also of the content being generated [According to Lexology](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=93cf3f01-5e64-4088-9af6-237fd38165e9#:~:text=The%20Copyright%20Office%20guidance%20indicates,Office%20will%20not%20register%20it) , “the Copyright Office guidance indicates AI-generated content may be copyright protected if the work is in some way original and unique.” But is content based on scraped and acquired data original? Also, what if that generated content comes from an AI model that is scraping data illegally? There are dozens of lawsuits going after large technology companies scraping AI model training data[ International Association of Privacy Professionals](https://iapp.org/news/a/lawsuit-accuses-openai-microsoft-of-illegal-data-scraping/).

These topics, and others, extend to how we look at utilizing AI in the Talent space. A recent post on the Reddit forum I moderated on r/humanresources was a call for advice on catching people using ChatGPT / Generative AI on their resumes. Surprisingly, the mass opinion was that no one cared if people used a tool (ChatGPT) to create their content; they viewed it no differently than hiring a writer or career coach. However, the problem stemmed from wrongfully representing themselves. Therein lies the danger: when you have something like AI creating content, with little visibility into how it is making the content and problems such as Hallucinations (incorrect or misleading results) from AI, you open yourself or your company up to liability or poor results. Just look at NYC’s AI chatbot telling [business’ to do illegal things](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/nycs-ai-chatbot-was-caught-telling-businesses-to-break-the-law-the-city-isnt-taking-it-down/5287713/). Similar problems in the talent world exist, such as [benefits chatbots](https://www.zendesk.com/blog/5-benefits-using-ai-bots-customer-service/) generating incorrect results for employees (or incoming candidates), which can open the company up to liability. I recommend that companies utilize strict RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) techniques to limit hallucinations and ground AI text generation by providing context. However, I still believe organizations should use these AI techniques to augment rather than replace HR &amp; recruitment professionals.

Lastly, I see many more companies interested in [measuring employee &amp; candidate experience trends](https://rexrecruiting.com/how-to-measure-candidate-experience/), which are important people metrics as they relate to employee performance, engagement, satisfaction, and retention, and turnover. These are topics that many companies, such as [Deloitte, have recognized as growing HR trends](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/human-capital-trends.html) . Candidate experience is important as it relates to the likelihood of hiring qualified candidates, and it is related to the outcomes of that candidate as an employee. Furthermore, candidate experience impacts employer branding as well as consumer decisions. Simply put, if your company provides a poor candidate experience by hiring low-quality recruiters (or outsourced recruiters), having a poor interview process, or having marketplace misaligned jobs, you are hurting your company in a variety of ways. When talking about AI from a candidate experience perspective, the saying, “People join people, and people hire people,” comes to mind. Adding in-personal technology, such as an AI chatbot, removes that people element and retracts from the candidate’s experience.

In conclusion, the integration of AI in business, especially in the talent and HR sectors, poses both opportunities and challenges. As companies increasingly leverage AI to enhance candidate and employee experiences, it’s imperative to balance technological advancements with ethical considerations and human touch. While AI can significantly augment HR functions, it should not replace the nuanced judgment and empathy that human professionals bring to the table. Ensuring responsible use of AI, addressing potential biases, and maintaining transparency will be crucial in harnessing AI’s full potential while safeguarding against its pitfalls. Ultimately, fostering a holistic approach that values both technology and human interaction will be key to achieving sustainable success in the evolving landscape of AI in business.

Using my own LLM model running a Mistral model I created a TLDR (though its not that short lol)

TL;DR: AI in business, particularly in recruitment and talent acquisition, is growing in importance but is often misunderstood, conflating different aspects like process automation, analytics, and generative AI. Ethical and legal issues, such as data ownership and bias, are significant concerns, as demonstrated by Amazon's biased AI recruiting tool. The emergence of ""Prompt Engineering"" highlights the importance of understanding AI's capabilities and limitations. While AI can enhance HR functions, it shouldn't replace human judgment. Responsible AI use, addressing biases, and maintaining human interaction are essential for leveraging AI's benefits while avoiding its pitfalls in the talent and HR sectors",37,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1bzwpn6/ai_in_recruitment_talent_acquisition/,2024-04-09T16:39:13Z

You expect me to wait on the edge of my seat without knowing when and if the invite arrives? When this fuckup happened, you should have picked another date for the tests.  
Third, and most important: having candidates send you recordings of themselves for you to jerk off to for a CODING JOB is LAUGHABLE. Besides, I do not have a webcam and I would not ever consider infecting my phone with some random hiring app. It is ridiculous. Maybe try hackerrank next time.

AI hiring,recruitinghell,1ppyrfc,Just fired a “perfect hire” after 4 weeks,"I need to vent, but also genuinely ask how you guys are handling this.

I just had to reopen a req for a Senior role because our hire was a perfect match on paper, but week 3 on the job? The Hiring Manager calls me furious. The guy can’t do the basics. It’s becoming obvious his resume was likely AI-generated to beat the screener, and he memorized just enough to pass the interview.

It feels like the conventional resume is becoming a liability. With AI tools, anyone can look like a perfect match.

Honestly, I wish we could just move to a model where experience is ""Verified"" upfront so I don't have to guess if the PDF is real or ChatGPT.

Are you guys adding more assessment layers to combat this?

EDIT: I’m getting roasted in the comments so I want to clarify:

1. I messed up. I realize now this is a space for candidates to vent, and I walked in here complaining as a recruiter.
2. I am not looking for sympathy. Letting this person go wasn't just a ""cost"" to the company; it cost a human being their job security and left them with a gap on their CV. That is a failure of my process, not just their performance. I failed to assess them correctly, and we both paid the price.
3. The real reason I posted: I genuinely feel like the ""Resume + Interview"" system is broken. AI has made it easy to inflate a resume, but our screening process hasn't changed to catch it. We are judging people on how well they sell themselves, not what they have actually done. 

So, genuine question for you guys (since you are on the other side): If the Resume is becoming unreliable (because of AI), and you guys hate LeetCode/Assessments (rightfully so)... what is the alternative?",96,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1ppyrfc/just_fired_a_perfect_hire_after_4_weeks/,2025-12-18T18:49:44Z

AI recruiting,recruiting,1cpge8d,Automating Initial Screening Calls for Software Developers?,"
Hey fellow recruiters,

I was recently approached by a company that offers an AI-powered tool designed to automate the initial screening calls for software developers. Looks like this tool operates at the top of the recruitment funnel and designed to handle preliminary assessments through AI-driven conversations.
As someone who spends a considerable amount of time on phone screens, I'm intrigued but also a bit skeptical. The idea is that it can save us a lot of time by filtering out candidates and do it better than ATS with basic resume parsers. I’m so tired of GPT generated CVs.  On the other hand, I wonder if it might screen out good candidates who just don't interview well in such a format or miss out on the nuances that a human recruiter might catch. But if I can screen 50 engineers with this tool and save 100(50x20min for the screen) hours of my time , I’d use it. 

I'm curious to hear your thoughts:

 • Do you think such a tool could be effective in improving the quality and efficiency of the recruitment process?

 • Have you had any experience with similar automation tools?

 • What are your main concerns about relying on AI for initial candidate assessments?

Thanks in advance!",34,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1cpge8d/automating_initial_screening_calls_for_software/,2024-05-11T12:27:53Z

Having done tech talent sourcing for quite sometime now, I felt the entire process of talent sourcing to be be extremely tedious with infinite repetitive manual tasks of searching, screening, then pitching roles to each candidate. I feel I would like to focus more on delivering a great experience to candidates further down the funnel(shortlisted and beyond) rather than sitting behind a screen all day and searching and making cold calls to pitch a job opening to matching candidates.

To save myself the manual work, I built an AI engineered tool that instantly searches, screens and automatically pitches a job to matching candidates without any manual intervention. The matching candidates automatically receive a message on their WhatsApp and email with the detailed job description, company profile, founders profile, funding status etc. If a candidate likes the opening, they can express interest by clicking a button in WhatsApp and email. As soon as the candidate expresses interest, his profile, resume and contact information reaches recruiters inbox 🙂

AI recruiting,recruitmentagencies,1m9xy0b,Got bored one day and pretty much automated myself out of a job,"Been a recruiter for a couple of years now running my own agency. Was doing ok, but felt like I was spinning my wheels on the same dumb shit day in and day out. 

Sourcing was a huge time sink. Manually building lists, checking if they’re even a decent match, then the back-and-forth trying to schedule a 15-minute phone screen. 

I’ve got a bit of an engineering background, so I figured I’d try to code my way out of the parts I hated.

First thing I built was a better way to source. I hooked up GPT to spit out high quality boolean strings based on the job description, then run the search in linkedin/google and scrape all the matching profiles.I combine this with 1-2 other people search tools and the results are honestly great.

Then I built a requirements checker. My system creates a list of all the key requirements from the JD, which you can tweak after. Then it just rips through your whole list of candidates, checks each candidate profile against every requirement, and spits out a ranked list of who’s actually a good fit.

The last part was the AI phone screen agent. This was tough to build but definitely the most worth it, because I can’t be asked to set up another 15-minute call manually. It's basically a voice bot that holds a real, back-and-forth conversation with the candidate. Before the call, you feed it the JD, the candidate's resume, your list of screening questions. You can even tell it how to act—like, be professional but friendly, or to press for more details on a specific skill.

Because it has all that context, its follow-up questions are actually pretty smart. The best part is I don't have to schedule a damn thing. I just send candidates a link and they do the screen on their own time. Whenever they're done, the system drops the full transcript, a summary, and a recommendation in my lap. I can review the whole thing in under a minute and know if they’re worth forwarding. I still read the transcript, but I agree with the AI’s recommendation 99% of the time.

I also built a bunch of extra automations to handle simple shit that was just draining my time, like finding and outreaching new leads, generating candidate reports and a linkedin auto-message system=.

Not sure how useful this is for y’all’s workflow but for me it’s conservatively saved about 20 hours each week. I feel like we are all working too hard lol.

AI hiring,futurology,1o9rr11,AI is already replacing coworkers at my job,"I work in a software company in Spain, and lately I’ve started noticing something that honestly makes me quite scared: we’re hiring fewer and fewer junior testers. 

It’s not because the company is struggling, it’s because AI tools are doing a big part of the work that used to be done by juniors.

What surprises it’s how calm everyone seems about it. Most of the senior people in my team just shrug it off, like it’s not their problem. But to me, it’s obvious that if AI can replace juniors today, it will replace seniors tomorrow. Maybe not this year, maybe not next. But it’s coming.

I honestly didn’t expect to see this happening so soon, in 2025. I always thought automation would take longer to hit jobs like ours, where human judgment and testing intuition matter. But it’s already here, and it’s moving fast.

Why do we act like everything’s fine when it’s clearly not going to stay that way?

AI hiring,futurology,1koxnq8,AI Will Shift the Global Workforce Toward Data-Driven Oversight Roles,"I believe we are heading toward a fundamental shift in the global labor market. From agriculture to aerospace, AI will automate a vast portion of operational tasks, and what remains will be roles centered around monitoring, correcting, and guiding AI systems. In short, most industries will evolve toward data operating jobs in supervising the decisions and outputs of AI. Humans will serve more as guardrails, ethical overseers, quality controllers, and decision arbitrators. We'll act as the final check between AI and the real world.
Multinational companies will likely restructure their hiring priorities. Instead of seeking specialists for traditional roles, they'll look for people who can evaluate AI performance, audit algorithms, ensure compliance, and rucially injecting human judgment where needed. Think of courtroom decisions, HR issues, or sensitive negotiations where empathy, nuance, and ethics matter.

Examples include:

A lawyer no longer writing legal arguments, but assessing AI-drafted motions for fairness and context.

A farm manager not manually inspecting crops, but supervising AI-generated field reports and making decisions on the edge cases.

A journalist reviewing AI-curated news leads for truth and societal impact.

AI hiring,recruitmentagencies,1n5n6u2,AI hiring looked like a win… until the lawsuits started rolling in,"I’ve been telling people this for a while now, and after the Workday case it feels like the floodgates are opening.

AI in hiring sounded like the perfect fix — I know teams that cut screening time by 70% and processed 15,000+ applications a month. Huge win, right? But here’s the flip side: when bias creeps into those systems, it scales like crazy. What used to be 10 unfair rejections in a month can turn into 2,000 without anyone noticing.

The headlines keep piling up:

* iTutorGroup had to pay **$365,000** after their AI auto-rejected older applicants.
* Workday is facing a class action over bias against race, age, and disability.
* Sirius XM is the latest big name caught in the same storm.
* And the EEOC is fielding more AI-related complaints every month.

I wrote about this in an article and mentioned it in my newsletter — and a lot of people pushed back. Some argued compliance rules would slow things down, others claimed bias is a human problem, not a machine one. But the truth is, AI doesn’t magically erase bias — it multiplies it if you train it on bad data or deploy it without guardrails.

That’s where I think the conversation needs to shift. Instead of “AI or no AI,” it should be **how AI is trained and whether solutions are built with compliance in mind**. Things like:

* anonymizing candidate data before evaluation,
* running regular bias audits,
* keeping humans in the loop for oversight,
* documenting every AI decision for transparency.

Because like it or not, these tools aren’t going away. The companies that figure out how to bake compliance into their systems from day one are the ones that won’t end up in court.

All I’m trying to say is… we have to be careful. AI can help, but only if it’s designed responsibly.

Curious if anyone here has seen their company take the compliance-first route with AI hiring? Or is everyone still chasing speed and hoping the lawsuits miss them?",30,https://www.reddit.com/r/RecruitmentAgencies/comments/1n5n6u2/ai_hiring_looked_like_a_win_until_the_lawsuits/,2025-09-01T12:20:21Z

recruitment automation,recruitinghell,1q5wcyv,"The current job market crisis is worse than 2008. It's not a cycle, it's a downward spiral.","I was in middle school when the 2008 recession went into full swing, and I remember those days quite distinctly despite not necessarily being old enough to comprehend the full scale of the disaster. Ultimately, while the crisis was dire for many, including my own parents who lost their jobs and had to scrape by with part-time work, the underlying structure of the economy and job market remained intact. The financial sector was essentially frozen and consumer spending fell off a cliff, but the crisis was stabilized with bailouts and the system slowly healed (even if it's arguable that any meaningful lessons were learned). The problem we face now is far more dire than a simple slump: it's a redesign of the idea of “work"", and no one is truly safe from the future of what's to come.

A.I isn’t merely a productivity tool like a faster spreadsheet or a better CRM; it’s being deployed as a substitute for tasks that used to justify entire roles, especially entry-level and mid-level “information work.” Even if A.I can't currently replace all white collar work, it is undeniable that many junior-level office jobs can have their essential tasks easily completed by A.I, and large teams can be shrunken. On top of A.I, offshoring is a global phenomenon that has spent decades optimizing how to convert salaried roles into geographically flexible units of labor. In 2008, you could say that the job market was paused. Now the jobs are being deleted, atomized, transferred elsewhere, or converted into unstable contract work.

A.I selectively punishes the roles that can be broken down into repeatable cognitive text-based tasks: drafting, summarizing, triaging, translating, formatting, basic analysis, customer support scripts, simple coding, documentation, project coordination, routine marketing copy, and the other office work frequently tackled by juniors. A company that previously hired juniors and trained them might now rely on existing mid-levels who are utilizing A.I to replace the juniors previously in the pipeline. For those wondering how mid-levels and seniors will be trained up if juniors are no longer hired-well, that's a problem for the next group of shareholders, and no one can say for certain if A.I won't advance to the point where even mid-levels and seniors aren't safe. In 2008, a lot of people were forced to wait for the market to recover, but now people are being denied the chance to start in the first place.

The worst part is that ""recovery"" doesn't necessarily mean the jobs will return. This is the heart of why today feels worse than 2008: the normal recovery story of demand returning and hiring rebounding will never happen when technology, offshoring, and market tricks allow expansion without proportional domestic hiring. In the new paradigm, output can be increased by turning on more automation, licensing more A.I seats, scaling vendor contracts, offshoring more functions, and asking a smaller domestic workforce to do more and more. So, we end up having an economy that looks “fine” in aggregate-even outstanding when looking at stock market gains-while large segments of the labor force are disposable. You can have GDP growth without job growth. You can have stock market optimism alongside populational despair. That decoupling is what makes the idea of recovery from the current state of the job market a faint hope.

Another reason the current market feels especially bleak is the structure of hiring. In 2008, hiring froze, but the process still resembled human selection. Now the process has ATS systems pre-filtering resumes, ghost jobs, multiple rounds of interviews and take-homes, and a general atmosphere of being an employer's market. Labor has lost it's bargaining power, and every step of the recruitment process has become more degrading and time-consuming. In 2008, it was easy to understand that unemployment was caused by frozen credit as the financial sector healed and the subsequent collapse of consumer spending. Now, the message being sent by the job market is that unemployment is a feature, not a bug, of the new paradigm.

Unfortunately, in this new paradigm employees have almost no leverage. You can’t outwork an algorithm that makes “good enough” output at near-zero marginal cost. You can’t compete with wage arbitrage across borders unless you accept the same wage. You can’t retrain fast enough if the category you retrain into is the next one being automated, or the sector you are trying to break into is being swarmed by everyone else looking for the next golden ticket out (nursing, trades, etc.). The only jobs that will exist in the foreseeable future are those heavily gatekept behind regulatory capture which prevents outsourcing or automation, such as the longshoremen who cling on to their jobs despite port automation being easily feasible.

Companies has powerful incentives to treat A.I and offshoring as strategic advantages. Fewer employees means fewer HR issues, fewer benefits, fewer lawsuits, fewer morale concerns, fewer people quitting, fewer complications. The modern corporation already tends to treat labor as a liability rather than an asset. A.I and offshoring make that worldview operationally feasible at scale. So even when the macro environment improves, the paradigm stays the same. Once the organization learns it can function without the headcount, bringing headcount back feels like inefficiency it can't tolerate in an economy where all of their competitors are working 20% of their employees for 200% of the normal output.

2008 was a collapse of demand. This is a collapse of leverage, and a permanent paradigm shift where workers have fewer capacity than ever to reclaim it. One is fixable with time, policy, and a return of spending. The other is embedded in technology and global supply chains. You can’t un-invent A.I, and you can’t deglobalize labor without enormous political upheaval. That is why in my brutally honest opinion, recovery from this crisis is unlikely, and even if we see some signs of improvement in the job market, the underlying currents of offshoring and automation will continue to pull us into the abyss.",385,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1q5wcyv/the_current_job_market_crisis_is_worse_than_2008/,2026-01-06T21:53:43Z
recruitment automation,recruitinghell,1pqjybb,This is exactly why all the talk about 'ATS-friendly' resumes feels like total bullshit.,"I recently interviewed with a recruiter for an HR Tech role. On paper and in person, it was a perfect match: same ICP, same enterprise clients, and the same space I’ve been selling into for 7 years. The recruiter loved it and told me to apply through their portal.

I did. And the ATS immediately flagged me as 'not a match’

Here’s the kicker: This is an HR company, selling HR software, hiring for an HR Sales role. Yet their own system couldn't recognize basic HR domain language. It wasn’t a formatting error the resume was clean. The system just had zero clue what it was looking at. Acronyms and core concepts were treated like noise.

It really makes you wonder if an HR company can't even configure its own tech to recognize basic HR terminology, what are we even doing?

We’ve reached a point where we’re trusting tools built for 'processing volume' to make suitability calls they aren't equipped to make. A human recruiter saw the fit in minutes, but the machine overruled them because it wasn't programmed to understand the actual market.

If recruiters don't put in the actual work to set these systems up properly, 'automation' is just a fancy word for structural friction. We’re not making hiring faster we’re just getting better at ignoring the right people.

And if so, how did it affect your efficiency and quality of talent you brought forward to Hiring Managers?",43,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/11g6mh8/is_video_prescreening_helpful/,2023-03-02T16:13:09Z
automated candidate screening,futurology,kj2df1,Why Americans will never accept automation,"Automation is tied to socialism, and socialism is tied to communism. This is the way Americans think.

The automation of the workforce is a jobs killer, and when you kill off jobs, the way to fix this is with UBI (Universal Basic Income), and this is where things get messy, because when you describe UBI to Americans, the first thought you'd get is, ""Oh shit man, that sounds like socialism,"" and you know Americans hate socialism, because during a election, the mere mention of socialism by a candidate is a death sentence to their campaign, because Americans connect socialism with communism.

My father, who was born in the 1950s, think this as well, he says automation will be ultimately rejected by Americans because they don't want to lose their jobs and rely on government handouts (UBI). My father says that UBI gives the government too much control of the population which is like socialism, then it will give rise to communism. The only way for socialism to work, according to my father, is for politicians to be honest, clean and transparent, but this isn't the case in America, in fact, America has one of the dirtiest politics in the world. So is my father right?",28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/kj2df1/why_americans_will_never_accept_automation/,2020-12-23T22:03:51Z
interview bot,recruitinghell,1qcvroq,"Deel used 6,000 job seekers as ""props"" for a Guinness World Record stunt &amp; partner funnel today","Feeling played. I have been interested in Deel for a while, but today’s ""Get Inspired, Get Hired"" virtual hiring event was one of the most tone-deaf corporate ego-trips I’ve ever seen.

The invite explicitly promised ""live and interactive conversations with Revenue leaders"" (hiring managers) and a ""guaranteed interview"" post-event. I actually spent time prepping for real human interaction. Instead, I joined a Zoom webinar with over 6,000 other people.

**The PR Stunt:** One of the first things they bragged about was how this event was officially going into the Guinness Book of World Records for the ""largest virtual hiring event ever."" The entire call felt like an investor deck pitch, not a recruiting event. They spent almost the entire hour celebrating their own growth metrics and revenue milestones while 6,000 people (many of whom are currently struggling to find work) watched in the chat. The ""human element"" they promoted was a total bait-and-switch. *\[EDIT\] Sadly, the very first person introduced on the call wasn't a recruiter or a department head, it was an ""Official Adjudicator"" from the Guinness Book of World Records. By the end of the call, the adjudicator came back on to officially ""verify"" the record. It was surreal.*

**The ""Interview"" (A Gift to their Partners):** Then came the kicker: the ""guaranteed interview."" It turns out there is no ""guarantee"" of actually talking to a human being. Instead, the ""interview"" is just a mandatory AI video assessment powered by Micro1 and Metaview, who, surprise surprise, were ""sponsored partners"" of the event (this and it being a partner sponsored event was never mentioned in the invite).

You don't get a chance to build rapport or ask questions. You just get the ""privilege"" of recording yourself for a bot to then possibly speak to a hiring manager down the line. It felt like the entire event was less about hiring people and more about delivering 6,000 sets of training data to their corporate partners. They aren’t opening doors for job seekers; they’re just feeding an AI ecosystem and calling it ""innovation.""

**The ""Interaction"":**

* **The Q&amp;A:** Out of a 60-minute event, they only opened it up for questions with 9 minutes left. Imagine trying to facilitate a meaningful Q&amp;A for 6,000 people in 9 minutes.
* **The Format:** While the invite mentioned a ""Bonus: Be part of a Guinness World Record attempt,"" (last line of the email invite), it was never made clear that the entire format would be sacrificed for a PR plaque and a partner funnel.

It’s clear this wasn't about supporting job seekers; it was a massive top-of-funnel marketing boost to harvest data and secure a PR headline. We weren't candidates today, we were just free extras in a Deel commercial so they could get a plaque for their office wall and train their partner’s models. 

I’m all for innovative recruiting, but sitting through a PR stunt while thousands are struggling for work felt ***incredibly tone-deaf and exploitative.***",41,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1qcvroq/deel_used_6000_job_seekers_as_props_for_a/,2026-01-14T18:50:59Z

candidate ranking AI,recruitinghell,9zv5zu,HireVue Hell,"So, I'm sure some of you have had an encounter with ""HireVue""
When I got the email and it said:
""Candidates who complete a HireVue digital interview will be contacted first, so please complete your video as quickly as possible to speed up the process""
I was mortified, what if you don't have a phone that supports the app, don't have a pc ect? 
Are you just screwed?? 

Also what if your blind, deaf, deaf and no speach therapy, or have a speech impediment? 
The time it gives you to answer the questions isn't enough for a bad stutter, or sign language. 
What if you just... Mess up? 

I fell this also breeds discrimination, the employer can look at the video and go ""this quality is potato... NEXT"" or ""That one is wearing a hijab.... NEXT"" I know they aren't allowed to do this technically... But nothing is really stopping them from finding a reason to not hire you cause they don't like you. 

What if I have questions for My employer? This whole thing is like talking to a wall, it's not personal and it's like they are telling me I'm not worth their time. 

When I downloaded the app it didn't start, it kept crashing, and a second app that basically killed my phone came with it. This whole thing is just horrible, and if you don't complete the ""interview"" YOU DON'T GET HIRED. 

Great right?

As someone in AI, my perspective is probably skewed, but to me it feels like we're moving in this direction where there is no distinction between how we asssess AI (think https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard) and how we assess people.

candidate ranking AI,recruitinghell,1l2uujs,So tired of ATS it’s hurting talented and qualified candidates,"Today I experienced once again just how flawed the ATS and AI filtering systems that more and more companies use are. I applied for an internal promotion at my company. The position I applied for is in line with what I currently do and is a great step up for me. 

I have a lot of the required knowledge and experience. I would just need to be trained on what’s different with the new position. I applied for the position and reached out to the hiring manager. After some conversations, he agreed to meet me in person. 

During our conversation, which was great and very informative, he revealed that he couldn’t even see my application on his pipeline because the ATS system filtered me out. How ridiculous is it that a company’s ATS system will filter out internal candidates looking to move up? He literally told me that if I hadn’t reached out to him personally, he never would have even known I was interested. He even told me that the corporate recruiter basically dodged his questions when he asked why this happened. 

He thinks that I’m a strong candidate for this position and is going to be personally involved in my learning and development so I can join his team. So the takeaway here for all the job seekers in this community is if there is a job that you believe you’re a great fit for, you have to reach out to someone. Whether it’s by phone, email, DM, or whatever. Don’t assume your application will be seen since AI has no problem auto-rejecting qualified candidates and even internal applications.  

Hopefully I’ll be able to land this opportunity and finally be done with this job search nightmare. Good luck to everyone out there going through the same nonsense.",50,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1l2uujs/so_tired_of_ats_its_hurting_talented_and/,2025-06-04T02:51:50Z
