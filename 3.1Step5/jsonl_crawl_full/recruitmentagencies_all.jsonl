What I have designed is checkpoints in the process that specifically are high stakes (for example matching a candidates resume to a job, scoring specific aspects) and during the checkpoint you can review and approve/provide feedback on each step.\n\nA little complicated but what I’ve found works is dialectical reasoning with proper context provided.\n\nExample: AI model is loaded with key examples of what is expected, and it is given instructions to work on one indicator at a time, for each indicator it is instructed to \n\n-generate an argument for the presence of an indicator\n-generate a counter-argument for the absence of an indicator\n-use case history examples and definition of indicator for each decision \n-finally weigh the process and decide which one is truly present \n\nThis could apply to recruitment as well, specifically resumes. Breaking down the aspects of their skills experience and also interview transcripts (assuming they have agreed and acknowledge you are recording the interview)\n\nFinally: I think that this applies to AI as a whole, the driving philosophy of AI tools should be assistance in making decisions, automation of grunt work and manual data tasks, and basically being used for what it is: a tool.\n\nI do not believe we should be having AI agents be recruiters.\n\nRecruiters should still be recruiting and doing what they do best which is connecting on a human level and getting someone excited about an opportunity, AI should do the stuff that allows you more time to connect. \n\nLike, personally: I love my resume formatting tools.

AI-powered assessment plaforms like Testnhire now use simulations, gamified tests, and code analysis to measure what a candidate can actually do rather than where they went to school.\n\nThe Bottom Line: AI has turned recruiting from a transactional \"paper-pushing\" role into a strategic \"consulting\" role.

{"id": "nmv353i", "text": "Honestly, I’ve seen both the magic and the mess of AI in recruitment, so here’s what I think:\n\nWhere AI actually makes life easier:  \nFor me, the biggest win is removing the mind-numbing admin stuff. CV screening, email follow-ups, scheduling loops, “Hey, please take the test” reminders! AI absolutely eats those tasks for breakfast.\n\nI use Hyreo at work, and it handles things like candidate engagement, test coordination, interview scheduling, post-offer follow-ups, onboarding tickets… basically everything that usually drains half your day. It even flags high-risk joiners before they go cold, which has saved me multiple times.\n\nSo yes, matching, screening, nudging candidates… AI is brilliant at the repetitive pieces.\n\nWhere I still get nervous:  \nData privacy is a big one. Every time a new tool asks me to sync emails or upload candidate info, I have that “uhh… should I really be doing this?” moment.\n\nBias is another. If your training data is biased (and most historical hiring data is), the AI is just going to replicate it faster. Scary combination.\n\nAnd no matter how good the tech gets, candidates still want a human at key points. Nobody wants a bot telling them they didn’t get the job or ghosting them for 10 days. AI can support the process, but it can’t replace empathy.\n\nBut the worries are lesser with Hyreo because they’re GDPR compliant, and do data cleansing and continuous monitoring to eliminate bias. Plus the tool is not known for just Agentic recruiting but Agentic recruiting with human touch- ‘cause they allow human interventions at the right moments, which I think is great. \n\nI mean, why should a recruiter waste energy conversing with 100 applicants when he only has to deal with the top three with AI agents in the loop? \n\nSo is AI the next ‘LinkedIn moment’ for recruitment?  \n Honestly… yes.  \n Not because it replaces recruiters, but because it finally removes all the busywork that stops us from actually doing our real job: talking to people, understanding fit, and building relationships.", "timestamp": "2025-11-03T11:37:11Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "RecruitmentAgencies", "post_title": "Where do you think AI can actually help in recruitment", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RecruitmentAgencies/comments/1nicql1/where_do_you_think_ai_can_actually_help_in/"}}

Doesn't matter if they ran a plant for 15 years or interned at a manufacturing company one summer. That's not intelligence, that's ctrl+F with a subscription fee.\n\nThen you've got this doom loop where candidates are using AI to tailor resumes to job descriptions, so recruiters get hundreds of applications that all read the same.

Most candidates don't really read the job description they just read the Job title and click \"Easy Apply\"\n\n2. Keyword based screening: Conventional ATSs have conditioned recruiters to do keyword based search without any context and consequently it has conditioned the behavior of candidates to do keyword stuffing in their CVs. \n\n3. I have built products for 50 million monthly active candidates and ive spoken to a lot of candidates. Most candidates feel that a recruiter, who is screening their CVs as the first line of filter, doesn't have the domain expertise to evaluate their experience and skills. Because of this they try to mass apply to jobs hoping that their profile gets to the hiring manager bypassing the recruiter.\n\n4. All the admin pain is just crazy, obviously \n\n5. Recruiters genuinely can't humanly go through the amount of CVs they receive. Multiple recruiters, ive spoken to, tell me that they can barely spend 2 minutes per CV and even then they can't get through every application they've received. \n\nI can share a lot more pain points and the underlying context but the bottom line is that the way recruitment is done today ..... it's unfair to recruiters and it's high time that someone does something to change it.", "timestamp": "2025-09-19T06:26:24Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "RecruitmentAgencies", "post_title": "CV Screening is becoming a pain in the ass", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RecruitmentAgencies/comments/1m14qs6/cv_screening_is_becoming_a_pain_in_the_ass/"}}

{"id": "o5ri001", "text": "I agree with most of what you said but differ on a few things. One example, - \"Replacing the actual relationship-building part. That's still 100% human\". I don't think it necessarily has to be 100% human. \n\nJust to demonstrate, suppose you have 1,000 connections on your Linkedin network and want to leaverage that in your job serach (or recruiting) journey. For most people, most of these are probably cold, meaning you haven't interacted with them for some time, mayne 6 mths to 1 yr or more. It will take quite a bit of manual effort to reach out and reconnect with all of them., much less asking for a referral or reccommendation to someone or where they work. \n\nWhat about if you had a tool/service/app that can show you the state of all your connection, how long since you interacted with each, the strength (or weakness) of the relationship, your credibility with them i.e. will theuy vouch for you, have they endorsed etc. you or you them and how many time, have they done it more often for you or you for them i.e. do they owe you or do you owe them. What if it suggest the best ways to re-establish and strength the relationship and even craft thoughtful messages for you to review before send it to them.\n\nMore importantly, what it finds paths for warm introductions for you. e.g. you would like to apply for a job or reach out to a hiring manager at a perticular company. The app finds which of your connections are connected to someone that works at that company and can refer or reccoment you.\n\nYou can do all of this yourself but I'll bet it will take a long time and lots of effort. That's why I built the app that does all of that in minutes and manages it too, making your linkedin connections be valuable to you.

{"id": "ncjvfbf", "text": "Hey OP,\n\nThanks for calling attention to this. We’ve thought about this in a similar way. \n\nBias is not just some compliance thing that we need to deal with, because it directly impacts who gets shortlisted in hiring.\n\nWe’ve built our tool with this approach, the AI does not have access to ANY identifying information from the resume. \n\nBut this wasn’t really done for compliance. \n\nMe and my co-founder studied hundreds of articles about fair hiring practices (mostly from SHRM and CIPD). Even before AI, bias in hiring was a thing that people wanted to deal with. There is a lot of info out there on how to deal with this for recruiting specifically (by well reputed and researched organizations).\n\nAnd of course, AI is going to have bias. Like you said, AI’s training data is based on real world stuff which is not unbiased. Asking AI to “make recommendations” given this context is a sure way for AI to just regurgitate bias in the training data.\n\nWith our tool, we prevent any bias inducing factors like name, place of residence, school name, gender, age etc. from being present in the evaluation step.\n\nThis means that the AI is only looking at job related  information on the resume and comparing it to a hiring criteria (with a lot of context so the AI still has enough information to go off of).\n\nOf course there’s the speed trade off when we were building, but we’d rather get it right than screw over a bunch of people.", "timestamp": "2025-09-05T13:16:38Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "RecruitmentAgencies", "post_title": "AI hiring looked like a win… until the lawsuits started rolling in", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RecruitmentAgencies/comments/1n5n6u2/ai_hiring_looked_like_a_win_until_the_lawsuits/"}}

The reason for my call is to see if that rumor is true and if it IS, can we help you like we helped ?\n\nWhat this does is show you know the market, you work the industry, you work with companies he/she knows, and you keep your ear to the ground. If they do not have an opening then \"Oh, I am sorry. maybe a different div? location? etc,\" then fact find if all else fails and connect on linkedin.\n\n**Marketing an MPC**\n\nThis is an industry standard and used buy tons in the industry. Instead of me explaining check out The Recruiter Roundtable on YouTube. Season 2 has a great MPC episode. \n\n**KISS email**\n\nKISS or \"Keep It Simple Stupid\" So often recruiters want to send novel level emails and the HM get these over and over. The last few months one of my recruiters has been sending out a simple email. Something like this\n\nWe haven't met, but I'm reaching out because I just successfully wrapped up a search for a ___________ at a similar company to ____________ I have a couple of/2 candidates who I connected with too late in the process that I think were really exceptional.\n\nBoth have _______ and _____ experience.\n\nWould you have interest in knowing more about these candidates or discussing what skill set would be a better fit for your team?\n\nThis has gotten her a dozen searches from 5 different companies. All 25% fee\n\n**Ambulance chasing on Linkedin Sales Nav**\n\nThis is the newest way we have been looking at getting new clients. It is a little harder than the other 3 BUT if you have a good VA they could do this for you. It may work on recruiter/recruiter lite but I do not know because Sales nav is better (fight me)\n\nHere is what you do.\n\nIn sales nav you choose the following search operators.\n\nYEARS IN CURRENT CO -\"less than 1 year\"\n\nunder the \"spotlights\" section \"Changed Jobs in the last 90 days\"\n\nThen pick your industry, title/past title, keyword, etc...\n\nThe idea is you now can see what company they left, and it is probable that company needs to fill the position they left.\n\nI just did it with\n\n• Past Job Title \"developer\"\n• Industry \"software Developer\"\n• Geography \"north America\"\n\nand got 12,000 results\n\nI added\n\n• \"3-5 years Exp\"\nand Narrowed it to 3,000 results\n\nNocuew, some are going to be promotions, different Divisions, etc.. but that is why I said it was harder and why a VA would be a good choice.\n\nWith Sales Nav you could do this lots a different ways depending on the industry, types of positions you fill and more.\n\nEven for Exec Positions. I just did it with CFO and \"technology, Information and Internet\" and got 198. IF that is your niche you could congratulate 198 CFO's and ask if their old co filled there post in a non-sales way. Changed the past title to VP and I got 1000 plus.\n\nThere ya go. 4 Ways to develop business and call/email HM to develop relationships.

We've been wrestling with this exact nightmare for months.**\n\nThe volume is absolutely insane lately - feels like every job post is a magnet for every bot and unqualified applicant on the planet. Here's what's actually moved the needle for us:\n\n**What's working:**\n\n* **AI that actually gets context** \\- We switched from basic keyword matching to something that understands what candidates are really saying. Game changer. Instead of just flagging \"5 years experience,\" it picks up on relevant project work, transferable skills, even career pivots that make sense.\n* **Multi-stage filtering** \\- First pass removes obvious mismatches (wrong location, visa issues, etc.), second pass does the smart analysis\n* **Quick phone screens** \\- 10-minute calls save hours of back-and-forth later\n\n**What flopped hard:**\n\n* Raising requirements (you're right, scared off good people)\n* Premium job board spots (just got us more volume, not better quality)\n* Manual everything (RIP our weekends)\n\nThe real breakthrough was finding tools that don't just sort by keywords but actually understand candidate potential. We're using [EasyHireapp.com](http://EasyHireapp.com) 's AI analysis now and it's been a total lifesaver - catches those \"diamond in the rough\" candidates that traditional filters miss completely.\n\n**Pro tip:** Test your filtering on a batch of known good hires. If your system would've filtered them out, it's too strict.\n\nWhat's your current setup? Are you mostly manual or using any automation?

{"id": "k1ido2d", "text": "The struggle of finding a reliable and efficient resume parser is real, especially when you have a massive batch of resumes to go through. So as I can tell, you're in need of a tool that not only parses resumes efficiently but also integrates seamlessly with your current ATS.\n\n  \nRecently, I came across a tool that might just be the solution to your problem - Recruit CRM. They have recently introduced an [AI-powered resume parsing feature](https://recruitcrm.io/blogs/recruit-crm-ai-candidate-matching-resume-parsing/?utm_source=reddit+&amp;utm_medium=reddit+organic+syndication&amp;utm_campaign=011-+Answer) that seems to be quite promising. It's integrated with Sovren, a global leader in resume reviewing technology, known for its accuracy and comprehensive data extraction capabilities.\n\n  \nWhat makes it stand out is its ability to extract a wide range of details from a resume, including work and education history, social media URLs, and more, providing a holistic view of the candidate. It even offers multilingual support, which could be a great asset if you're looking to expand your talent pool globally.  \n\n\n  \nMoreover, it can work with resumes received from various sources, ensuring no potential candidate is overlooked, no matter how their resume is submitted. And the best part? It can integrate with other tools and workflows you might be using through API and Zapier integration, offering flexibility and enhancing your recruitment process.  \n\n\n  \nDo check it out and see if it meets your requirements. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck!", "timestamp": "2023-09-21T02:25:49Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "RecruitmentAgencies", "post_title": "resume Parsing Software", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RecruitmentAgencies/comments/16jgttn/resume_parsing_software/"}}

I used it once for a huge pile of resumes, and it worked great with our Zoho ATS. Their pricing is flexible too, so you're not paying for more than you need.  \n  \nSovren's another solid choice. It's known for being accurate and thorough. Once you get into it, it's actually fairly simple, even though it may appear a little technical at first. It sounds like the ideal solution—exporting data to a spreadsheet is really simple.  \n  \nBoth offer demos or trials, which I found really helpful when I was choosing. It's a great way to see which one fits your workflow better before you commit.  \n  \nFor exact pricing, just reach out to their sales teams.

We tried a bunch of different approaches and the one that worked best was having the system flag specific keywords/experiences but then letting recruiters quickly validate those flags instead of reading everything from scratch.\n\nFor pricing, most small agencies we work with seem comfortable with $200-400/month for something that actually saves them hours per week. But you gotta nail the job posting distribution - that's where the real value is. We integrated with Indeed, LinkedIn, AngelList, and a bunch of niche boards all through one interface and that feature alone pays for itself. The screening part is nice but the multi-posting saves so much repetitive work it's ridiculous.\n\nOne thing nobody mentions - make sure your tool can handle the weird edge cases. Like when clients send job descriptions in random Word docs with tracked changes everywhere, or when they want to post the same role but with slightly different requirements for different locations. Those little annoyances add up and if your tool can't handle them smoothly, people will just go back to their manual process even if it takes longer.

Boolean only finds what you can explicitly describe, so you end up defaulting to the same keywords and the same people.\n\nTo answer your questions honestly: yes, AI/semantic search on your existing database can surface people you'd never find with boolean. The classic example is searching for \"someone with agency recruitment experience who moved into talent acquisition\" and actually getting results based on career trajectory, not just keyword matches. Boolean can't do that.\n\n**But** a lot of vendors are faking it. They put a natural language input box on top of the same keyword matching engine and call it AI. The test is simple: run a search using a description with *no* job titles or industry keywords in it, just a profile description. If it returns nothing, it's just keyword search wearing a costume.\n\nThe real question for your situation is whether you want a tool that layers on top of Bullhorn (there are a few that plug in via API and re-index your data) or whether you'd consider migrating.

{"id": "motsn6p", "text": "Congrats! Just took the leap myself. I made some tech mistakes along the way- here’s my advice. \n\n\n1. You need a CRM. I wanted to use excel and one note and get one later as I got busier, but if you’re to having one, you’re going to feel naked without having it there. It can also really automate and speed up processes for you. \nPlan to spend a week demoing a few: I demoed Manatal, Loxo, ZohoCRM and looked at getting Bullborn bc I was so used to it. \n\n2. Build email domain health. I was stupid this way and didn’t realize I needed to do this. You can’t just send 50 emails the first day out to your old clients, you need to start slow so you don’t end up in company’s spam. I use Zoho mail for my domain. I love it and use it over outlook eventhough I have it. You need to understand DNS settings \n\n\n3. Website - you need one. Especially with so many spammers in the market. I used Canva and pay $15 a month for hosting. I am not tech savvy and was able to do it in a few days and have gotten good feedback. If you’re more advanced look at squarespace elementor etc you can also use Canva pro for a month for free and make marketing docs, invoice templates, and contracts. \n\n4. Make sure you have the right computer for running all these programs. I was an idiot using 4GB and it was so infuriating slow I barely got anything done without flipping out the first few weeks. I’m a tech idiot though so feel free to roast me for this oversight. 😂 I bought at 16GB stick off amazon and it should speed it up. \n\n5. Take time and build your brand- you have to look legit in this market. LinkedIn premium is free for one month and will give you 50 inmails\n\n6. Save by using extensions and new tech. LI recruiter is $600 a month a waste of money. So are things like zoom info. I picked loxo crm and it’s like the toy I never had in the agencies I worked in. It has an extension that auto imports profiles into the system, you can run it in tandem with Apollo or salesql lookup and just add in the info. Loxo also auto adds the company into the companies tab, and pulls candidates in from LinkedIn—building you a database of candidates bypassing LinkedIn recruiter. You also get 250 free personal email lookups a month so can be v handy for candidate out reach. \n\n7. I use sales nav in tandem with the other two extensions up top. Utilize free trials- I haven’t had to pay for email lookups yet and have added over 200 a month. \n\n8. Make sure your contract is legit. Check every single word or better yet copy your old firms. You can fucked by not adding in a word here and there, like a “one time” free replacement guarantee or “Prorated” guarantee—and 12 month candidate referral clause. (May be common sense sorry!)\n\n9. Use something like docuseal for contract signing. I haven’t signed up yet bc I haven’t made it there but I’m not working jobs unless contract is signed, this is 100% your profit now not the agency you worked for so get rid of those bad habits. 12 month candidate referral guarantee goes a long way and I’ve seen it left out my old agencies contract. Keep your contract very simple and just cover the bases. I’ve only been in legal trouble once in my old firm and that was to claim back my candidate being hired through another agency when I sent him first, but this stuff matters.  I do work in an industry where clients try and do this stuff and I’ve claimed back placement fees after finding they hired my candidate months later. Also do 15 net payment terms. They’ll probably pay in 30. If you do 30, they pay at 45 lol from history of my clients. If they ask to extend (great) at least they’re showing they’re serious about paying on time. Also try 60 day replacement unless someone pushes you to 90. (Again, sorry if common sense or sounds patronising. Just worked with some v experienced people who didn’t need to worry about this in prev firms for some reason)\n\n10. Obviously register your business. I’m in Delaware and didn’t think about how backlogged they’d be with them being the LLC capital of the country/ mine just went through today after filing in early Feb. Make sure to go to the government website or your states website, you don’t need to pay someone to do this. \n\n11. Obvs set up a business bank account for W9 etc. Set goals for yourself, decide how much you need to pay yourself to support your expenses and carry over profit as much as you can to stay ahead of yourself and have peace of mind/prepare for cyclical or down times like summer \n\nEdit - I used Canva pro free trial for logo design too. Make sure that looks legit. It’s super easy to use. The first one I had I did on pixiAI or something and it looked shit. You need a company LinkedIn page and proper logo—also I used a FaceTune free 7 day trial and was able to add photos of myself, airbrush them and add a blazer on myself under the “professional headshots” section. This also goes a long way. It doesn’t look AI-ish either lol I was impressed \n\nAny questions dm me\n\nOverheads look like this: \n\nMonthly \n\nLoxo CRM $209\n\nCanva for web hosting/design stuff $15\n\nSales Nav $109 \n\nAT&amp;T $100 (I have a biz account and you can put your company name on your called id) AT&amp;T do deals for biz accounts too sometimes so look for those, I got a free watch. Otherwise your cell is fine. Or you can use a VOIP \n\nOther costs/ one offs:\n\nLlc formation $150\n\nZoho mail yearly $12\n\n\nAnd just to add to answer your question on biggest obstacle. Mine was the email domain warming up thing. Huge oversight on my end. I’m a month behind now because I can only send a certain amount of emails a day and my outreach is cold bc of non compete reasons, plus I work with many clients not like 3-4 who give me a steady flow of jobs given my industry and niche. \nI also spent almost a week uploading CSV into Zoho and decided I didn’t like it. (Customer service is not great imo, and I had the wrong crm purchased and it was NoT straight forward) but love them for mail. Just demo and find what works for you but loxo is it trust me lol\n\nAnd I’m going to be honest here as I’m anon. lol—this is leanest/lowest cost I’ve found. I’m legit starting this business with about $5K in savings (obviously rent is covered) but it gives me until August to get a fee. It didn’t happen as quickly for me as I thought, but again I shot myself in the foot with the email thing and it kind of threw me off", "timestamp": "2025-04-24T17:49:55Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "RecruitmentAgencies", "post_title": "Starting my recruitment agency - any tips?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RecruitmentAgencies/comments/1k64oje/starting_my_recruitment_agency_any_tips/"}}

{"id": "mpqr3sk", "text": "To be fair, I got this advice for a lot of experienced recruiters who run their own shop. I think the computer and email settings could be obvious to some, but not me lol and no one mentioned it. It’s a lot easier if you can move your clients over and don’t need to do cold outreach. That’s what most I know do. I was out of market for almost a year with a chronic illness (treated now) so I lost a lot of mine to my former agencies unfortunately. Especially with the email thing, I don’t want to ad chase but I only have a certain number of emails I can hit a day..and what’s killing me the most is not knowing what the market is like BD wise.

I’d love for after the call for N8N or Make to use whisper (ChatGPT) to transcribe it, use a gpt to summarize, send to word to make document, send document to a folder in the cloud drive as well as attach it to the candidate in my ATS (my ats has an open api so this is possible) \n\nThe one thing I use that most don’t it typingmind instead of ChatGPT or Claude or Gemini. \n\nTypingmind allows you to use the api keys if the 3 big LLM as well as so many others like Gronk, DeepSeek,etc as well as many others via open router api key. \n\nWith typingmind I only play for usage.

Automate the admin around it (notes, summaries, reminders), but keep decisions human.\n\nOne thing I’d strongly suggest before adding more tools is mapping where your time actually goes in a normal week. Automate the highest-frequency tasks first.

Here’s a quick take to get you started, and feel free to reach out if you have follow-up questions.\n\nOver the years, I’ve worked with a ton of different staffing software platforms, and honestly, Avionté has been the most solid all-around option I’ve come across. It covers pretty much everything you’d need.\n\nRight now, I’m working with Bullhorn, and it’s been… challenging. There’s a noticeable lag that makes data entry feel like a chore, and it takes way too many clicks to complete simple tasks. That’s just scratching the surface. The cost is also pretty steep, and one major downside for us is that it doesn’t handle invoicing.\n\nIf I knew a badass developer or software engineer who wanted to collaborate on a next-gen staffing solution, I’d be all in. I’ve got a whole concept just sitting in my files, waiting for the right person to help bring it to life. Until then, I’ll keep refining the idea.\n\nHope this helps with what you’re looking for!", "timestamp": "2025-05-29T19:07:04Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "RecruitmentAgencies", "post_title": "\"best” staffing software", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RecruitmentAgencies/comments/1kyhkcr/best_staffing_software/"}}

{"id": "ncd21h0", "text": "Navigating the sea of staffing software options is definitely a challenge, and I appreciate you laying out such a thoughtful guide! Your breakdown of key factors like centralized data, automation, and integrations is spot on.\n\nI've seen firsthand how agencies struggle with this. Many of the \"legacy\" systems feel clunky and are built on outdated architecture, forcing agencies to piece together multiple tools just to get the job done. This creates more administrative work and often results in fragmented data.\n\nThat's why a truly all-in-one platform is a game-changer. It's not just about consolidating features; it's about building them to work together seamlessly from the ground up. Take [Aqore staffing Software](https://www.aqore.com/products/zenople-by-aqore/), for instance. We've built our platform to handle everything from front-office recruitment (ATS, CRM) to back-office functions (timesheets, payroll, invoicing). This means your data is always unified, and you can automate workflows across the entire staffing lifecycle, saving a ton of time.\n\nThe biggest hurdle I've seen is when agencies try to fit their unique process into a rigid software box. The software should adapt to you, not the other way around. Finding a solution that offers genuine flexibility, comprehensive support, and keeps evolving with new features (like AI-driven candidate matching and sourcing) is key.", "timestamp": "2025-09-04T12:30:03Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "RecruitmentAgencies", "post_title": "\"best” staffing software", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RecruitmentAgencies/comments/1kyhkcr/best_staffing_software/"}}
{"id": "nsb5a1f", "text": "A lot of teams run into the same issues when sorting through staffing software, and the volume of options definitely doesn’t make it easier. One pattern that comes up often is how quickly the complexity of disconnected tools adds up. Centralized data and native functionality tend to make the biggest difference in day-to-day recruiting by reducing handoffs, duplicate entries, and reporting gaps.\n\nWorkflow flexibility is another major factor. Staffing teams rarely operate in a rigid, one-size-fits-all model, so highly configurable software usually supports growth more effectively. Automation, usability, and strong reporting are the core areas agencies focus on because they directly impact speed and placement quality.\n\nSmartSearch approaches the idea of a modern staffing software solution with a focus on being fully native and highly configurable from day one. It brings ATS, CRM, onboarding, automation, and reporting together in one unified environment rather than relying on disconnected tools. That kind of structure is what many staffing teams point to when describing software that actually supports fast, high-volume recruiting.", "timestamp": "2025-12-04T20:43:55Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "RecruitmentAgencies", "post_title": "\"best” staffing software", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RecruitmentAgencies/comments/1kyhkcr/best_staffing_software/"}}

Every time we get a CV, someone has to manually type out all the candidate info into our master spreadsheet. Takes forever and my team hates it.\n\nYour automation stuff sounds cool, but I'm wondering - do you handle the basic data extraction part? Like, if I upload a CV, can it automatically pull out the name, skills, location, contact info and populate fields? That alone would save us hours every week.\n\nAlso curious about cost. We're bootstrapped and can't afford enterprise-level pricing. Most \"recruitment automation\" tools I've looked at are like $200+ per user per month, which is insane for a 3-person shop.\n\nWhat's your target market?

{"id": "n37k112", "text": "I’ve been there. I used to work in a small agency, and we were exactly the same: spreadsheets, Outlook, sticky notes, and constantly chasing our tails on follow-ups. It gets exhausting fast.\n\nOne thing that really helped us was switching to HubSpot. I know it’s usually talked about like it’s for big teams, but honestly the free version is pretty solid, and the Starter tier is way more affordable than most of the other tools out there (definitely not $200+/user!).\n\nHere’s how it helped with the stuff you mentioned:\n\nCV data entry – It doesn’t auto-parse CVs natively, but we set up a simple flow using HubSpot forms + Zapier to grab basic info (name, skills, contact details) into the right fields. Plus, you can upload the CV and attach it to the candidate’s record, so everything’s in one place.\n\nNo templates – We created a few email templates so we weren’t rewriting the same messages over and over. Even on the free plan, you can save templates and track opens. Life saver.\n\nInterview scheduling – HubSpot has a built-in meeting link tool, like Calendly. Candidates can just pick a time and it syncs to your calendar. Way less back-and-forth.\n\nSticky notes – We swapped these for HubSpot Tasks. You can assign them, set follow-up reminders, and actually keep track of who needs chasing (without digging through sticky notes and random scribbles in notebooks!).\n\nIt felt like a big step, but once we got it going, it really took the pressure off and helped us look more organised (especially when juggling multiple roles).\n\nGood Luck!", "timestamp": "2025-07-15T05:02:22Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "RecruitmentAgencies", "post_title": "Recruiters — how are you handling candidate follow-ups and repetitive emails?

{"id": "nked1pr", "text": "Respectfully - In my opinion, with that plan you have a 30% chance of success if you're decently skilled at sales/closing, and a 10% if you're not. Every recruiter and their mom is trying mass email/linkedin outreach and they are getting absolutely crushed. You may get the odd job order here and there. You may make a quick buck, but you're not going to build a real repeatable book of business that way. Much less a company. The job orders you get from that style of business development are usually super hard to fill, the clients are cheap as hell, and they are usually a pain in the ass to deal with. \n\n  \nI would highly suggest a hyper-personalized approach to direct outreach. Pick a niche in a geographical area and get involved in actual networking in your area. Attend high-end events (the more expensive the better - serves as a barrier to entry). Also - cold outreach via phone is more effective than ever because every one is scared to do it (which is why everyone wants to make email/linkedIn work so badly). There are some other secrets but that's good for now :)\n\n  \nOne small nugget i'll throw out - go to every client meeting IN-PERSON. Not virtual. Recruiters all do the same shit, YOU'RE THE DIFFERENTIATOR. They have to LIKE you, they have to be sold on YOU. The odds of that happening virtually are very low. They are going to leave the meeting and forget about you in 5 minutes. Think of yourself as a lawyer. Why should someone work with you as a corporate lawyer when every other corporate lawyer does the same thing?", "timestamp": "2025-10-20T00:03:11Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "RecruitmentAgencies", "post_title": "Reality check: how feasible is it to start a recruiting agency without a strong network for first clients?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RecruitmentAgencies/comments/1o3tj1u/reality_check_how_feasible_is_it_to_start_a/"}}

{"id": "o0ugitn", "text": "It's interesting how many of us are now looking to port successful TA tech principles over to BD. Pin's ability to surface relevant profiles quickly is definitely a game-changer for candidate sourcing.\n\nHowever, the 'pulling phone numbers and emails' part for BD often introduces compliance and data quality tension that's less pronounced in TA. Many tools, while excellent at finding decision-makers, struggle with consistently providing verified contact details, especially for mid-market or niche industries outside of the typical tech/SaaS sphere. This leads to a lot of wasted outreach efforts and potential deliverability issues if not managed carefully.\n\nWhen evaluating, I tend to break it down into three core capabilities:   \n1. Lead Intelligence &amp; Data Enrichment (e.g., ZoomInfo, Apollo, Lusha – focusing on accuracy and depth beyond just email/phone),   \n2. Outreach Execution &amp; Personalization (e.g., Outreach, Salesloft, [Reply.io](http://Reply.io) – for sequences, A/B testing, CRM sync),  \n3. Workflow Automation &amp; Integration (how well it speaks to your existing CRM/project management tools). None excel equally across all three, requiring a 'best-of-breed' approach or a careful compromise.\n\nMy personal experience with AI-driven tools for sourcing niche clients has shown me that the true differentiator isn't just the sheer volume of data, but its relevance and proactivity. For example, I've used a system that doesn't just scrape LinkedIn, but actively predicts potential leads for niche roles based on industry shifts and public data, often flagging them weeks before a traditional job posting appears. This isn't about replacing human intuition, but augmenting it to cut down the 'manual research' by what feels like 80%. Its called [boilr.ai](http://boilr.ai) , in addtiton they indetnify the hiring center with all the managers, contact data and signals. Pretty solid system after I tried hary tying together the fragmented tool stack.

When we give short, focused tests that match the job, it shows us who actually has the right skills, not just who writes a great resume. Even senior candidates are okay with it if it feels fair and quick.\n\nWe did a study at Testlify and found that when companies used skills assessments early, they hired 32% faster and those new hires stayed in the job longer, about 20% better than before.\n\nSo yeah, mixing personal outreach with skill tests worked really well for us. Also, headhunt a lot. \n\nAlso, I’d love to know how you give feedback to senior folks, that’s something we’re still trying to improve too.", "timestamp": "2025-06-24T04:57:08Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "RecruitmentAgencies", "post_title": "Inbound Vs Outbound Sourcing for Executive/Senior Positions", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RecruitmentAgencies/comments/1lfhkq0/inbound_vs_outbound_sourcing_for_executivesenior/"}}

Any idiot with a phone and and email can call themselves a recruiter. \n\n2. It’s the only industry where your “product” can say “no, I don’t want to be sold”. It does not exist on any other industry. The jet you sell to bill gates does no change its mind or decide to stay with Gulfstream because it’s Lear jet wife does not want to move. The Porsche doesn’t decide after 2 weeks to go back to the dealership. You’re dealing with people and they change their minds and there is zero you can do about it. \n\nIn your case you’ve sold (most likely) a product. That is something tangible. Now you will be selling a service BUT a service that is dependent on a variable you have no control over. \n\nThink of all the other service based business people sell/provide. Lawyers are highly educated, required to get certified/pass the Bar and are regulated.  Accountants too. Realtors too. None of their “products” talk and even if they work on contingency the client is locked in a contract. The lawyer never has to worry about another lawyer settling the case. The realtor gets paid if they sell the house or someone else sells it. The account does have a client say “-I gave my books to you and two other accounting firms.
