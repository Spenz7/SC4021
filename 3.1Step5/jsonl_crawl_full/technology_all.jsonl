It's very common for someone to lie on their resume and not be able to code at all, but used enough buzzwords to slip through the hiring process somehow. They quickly get relegated to administrative tasks like making power points for their team. If they can do a bare minimum of busy work to not get fired right away, they'll probably survive at least until their annual performance review. By that time they have a year of experience in a respectable technical role, and they use that to convince another company to hire them before the first companies fires them(with a wage increase to boot).\n\n\nYou'd think that eventually their careers would collapse, but this type of person knows that they'll never be able to do the technical role, they're trying to land a middle management job where it doesn't matter that they aren't qualified to do the technical work. After they scam one or two companies, they'll land a management position, and nobody will know that their resume was a lie.\n\n\nI assume these \"artists\" are attempting a similar strategy.

{"id": "nsb1tkh", "text": "If my drawing tool's a wooden pencil I will probably begin by holding it in an *entirely different way* than beginner me did, to start out with broad, pale lines, and to better align my body for my entire arm to get into making the drawing happen - this makes for more flowing images, and also avoids putting stress on your very vulnerable wrist joint. When I got into the animation industry around the 00's all the old hands beat this pencil grip into me, because they all had horror stories about colleagues who had to cut their careers short due to wrist injuries.\n\n(I might not do this depending on my mood; if you give me a mechanical pencil I *certainly* won't do this because that doesn't *work* with those, but I'll still be drawing with my whole arm active, instead of my arm being mostly dead weight atop my wrist, with my lines limited to what I can make by moving the pencil around.)\n\nI will rough in shapes very quickly, with the confidence gained from a couple decades of drawing. I'll skip a lot of work that baby-pro me would have had to do on the paper, because I can do it in my head after a couple decades of practice. Both in terms of anatomy and in terms of any perspective that needs to happen on straight-edged props or background elements.\n\nI will casually draw intersecting objects overlapping each other, and erase the unneeded parts, instead of trying to make two disconnected parts match up.\n\nIf I want to show off I can do even more of it in my head, and just lay down ink lines with no preliminaries, but really that's for showing off. Or a certain kind of doodling. It's fun to do now and then but it gives me a headache after a while. If I practiced it more maybe it wouldn't. :)\n\nAll of this is stuff that I feel another pro would notice a few minutes of watching me drawing, if not seconds.

Please join me in welcoming Chris to HUD!”\n\nSweet’s role with the government will apparently involve an effort to use software to revise and downsize government regulations at the housing agency. The outlet writes:\n\n*Sweet’s primary role appears to be leading an effort to leverage artificial intelligence to review HUD’s regulations, compare them to the laws on which they are based, and identify areas where rules can be relaxed or removed altogether. (He has also been given read access to HUD’s data repository on public housing, known as the Public and Indian Housing Center Information Center, and its enterprise income verification systems, according to sources within the agency.)*", "timestamp": "2025-05-01T12:44:23Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "technology", "post_title": "DOGE Recruits College Kid to Help Rewrite Housing Regulations with AI", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1kc7sg1/doge_recruits_college_kid_to_help_rewrite_housing/"}}

Here's a strategic outline:\n\n\n---\n\n1. Establish a Global Trust with Transparent Governance\n\nStructure: A hybrid philanthropic-investment trust managed by a coalition of global leaders, scientists, economists, and ethicists—not by governments or corporations.\n\nGovernance: Transparency enforced through public blockchain ledgers, open budgets, and regular independent audits.\n\n\n\n---\n\n2. Allocate Wealth Across High-Impact Areas\n\nSplit into major categories with long-term ROI for humanity:\n\nSector\t% Allocation\tExample Uses\n\nClimate &amp; Environment\t25%\tCarbon capture, clean energy R&amp;D, reforestation, sustainable agriculture\nHealth &amp; Disease\t20%\tGlobal health equity, pandemic prevention, genetic disease research\nEducation &amp; Literacy\t15%\tOpen-source education platforms, teacher training, early childhood education\nPoverty Eradication\t15%\tUniversal basic income pilots, small business microloans, infrastructure in underserved regions\nTech for Good\t10%\tAI safety, open-access innovation, decentralized internet access\nCrisis Response\t5%\tEmergency relief fund for disasters, refugee aid, food systems resilience\nResearch &amp; Frontier Projects\t5%\tSpace exploration, longevity science, synthetic biology, existential risk mitigation\nOperating &amp; Scaling Costs\t5%\tManagement, data analysis, and logistics\n\n\n\n---\n\n3. Implementation Principles\n\nLeverage Existing NGOs: Work with proven organizations (e.g., Gates Foundation, WHO, GiveDirectly) instead of reinventing the wheel.\n\nEvidence-Based Giving: Fund projects with measurable outcomes (e.g., DALYs averted, carbon offset per dollar).\n\nLocal Empowerment: Ensure funding supports local leadership and cultural autonomy.\n\nScaling Innovation: Prioritize open-source tech and systemic policy shifts over band-aid solutions.\n\n\n\n---\n\n4. Long-Term Sustainability\n\nCreate perpetual endowments from a portion of the wealth, using earnings to fund initiatives indefinitely.\n\nInvest in ethical for-profit ventures whose success further finances philanthropic work (e.g., green energy companies).\n\n\n\n---\n\nWould you like a visual diagram of this global impact fund breakdown or a more detailed version for a specific sector like education or climate?", "timestamp": "2025-05-01T14:47:39Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "technology", "post_title": "DOGE Recruits College Kid to Help Rewrite Housing Regulations with AI", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1kc7sg1/doge_recruits_college_kid_to_help_rewrite_housing/"}}

The amount of resumes received is just staggering nowadays, especially when you only have 1 or 2 HR employees.  \n  \nMy company was hiring someone for my team, so I got to go through resumes to find a qualified applicant.  Around 85% of resumes don't match the criteria at all or are not even in the correct country.  So hundreds to thousands of resumes that had to be read and declined by HR outright.  Most seem to be people blasting the resume to every job out there (HR got the same resumes for multiple completely different job listings).  Others just applied because part of the job title was \"Engineer\" and it paid a high salary.  \n  \nOf the 15% that roughly match, about 1/3 still seem to be AI generated, some of them badly (random activities like Hiking / Swimming or companies like Zillow listed as \"Technical Skills\").  Some were declined because of random differences between resumes and LinkedIn profiles (different companies listed, different dates or job titles, different education.)  Some listed certifications that they planned to take in next 5 years (but don't currently have), so I assume that was to get around keyword filtering.  One resume said they graduated from a very prestigious school on the East Coast, while their LinkedIn (that they themselves added to the resume) said they went to a completely different school on the West Coast.  Multiple resumes stated education just as \"Harvard\".  On their LinkedIn, you would see that they \"attended\" a single free online class/seminar there.\n\nOf all the resumes we received.  8% made it past the Hiring Manager for me to review for technical competency.  Only \\~2% total seemed to meet most of the criteria, and were sent on to do first round interviews.  Of even the resumes going to interview, only 2-3 really had the full basic requirements we were looking for.  A lot of the others that are getting an interview were marked as \"Maybe\" because they may have the experience, but its hard to tell from the short descriptions they had on the resume. I didn't want to pass on some one that could still be a good fit.\n\nThe amount of time I have spent going through resumes instead of doing my day job ended up being a lot more than I had previously thought.  Hours and hours of reading resumes, checking LinkedIn, writing notes for HR.  Then reviewing them all again because HR wants to narrow it down further so that we aren't doing 50+ interviews.

{"id": "nmd1lbj", "text": "Yeah. And if you read the whole thing carefully, the headline is not what Powell says - it's what CEO's say. \n\n&gt;He noted “a significant number of companies” have recently announced layoffs or hiring pauses, with many of them explicitly citing AI as the reason.\n\nCompanies like to cite a reason for downsizing that's not \"we're not doing great right now\". Doesn't make it true. \n\n&gt;The comments come as the Fed cut interest rates by a quarter point to a range of 3.75%–4%, citing “downside risks to employment” even as inflation remains elevated. Powell said the U.S. economy is still expanding at a “moderate pace,” even as hiring slows. He described that spending as one of the “big sources of growth in the economy,” driven by companies building data centers and other equipment tied to artificial intelligence.\n\nSo, inflation (that trade war sure ain't helping here!) and lack of spending other than on AI. Those are old-fashioned reasons economies tank: less spending by consumers, fewer jobs, less spending by consumers. So much of this stuff is too removed from AI to have any direct effect on it.", "timestamp": "2025-10-31T12:48:32Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "technology", "post_title": "Jerome Powell says the AI hiring apocalypse is real: 'Job creation is pretty close to zero.’", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1okso7z/jerome_powell_says_the_ai_hiring_apocalypse_is/"}}

Investors have seen how companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook ultimately became monopolies (or duopolies) without any real legal challenges to that process, and now most investors just throw infinite money at high growth tech companies (regardless of actual profitability) hoping to be early investors in the next tech mega-monopoly, because doing so would entirely offset all their losses.\n\nSo real profitability almost doesn’t matter. They would rather see a company give away their product for free until they drive all their competitors out of business, just so they can capture the vast majority of the market share and eventually raise prices as a monopoly with maximum pricing power.\n\nThe main reason for the layoffs is that the investors are running out of cheap cash to throw at these companies, which is caused by higher interest rates. If you can get a billion-dollar loan at 1.5% interest to invest in a set of companies where at least one is expected to grow by 100,000%, then it makes sense to take that loan and invest. But if that interest rate jumps to 5%, then the calculation changes, and now all the companies that relied on unlimited investor cash have to actually cut spending for once, and layoffs are a fast way to do that.

This is why the high interest rates are having such a significant impact. The credit treadmill is all that has kept the working class afloat for the past three decades. Prior to around 2022-2023 when CD rates hit 5% APY, it has probably been about two decades since I last remember being able to get more than 2% out of any FDIC-insured account, all while inflation regularly hovered at or above 2%. It's been a long time since all but high-risk investments actually outpaced inflation.\n\nBut on the flip side, mortgage and auto loan rates were consistently low for more than a decade. And aside from predatory credit, like payday loans and credit card interest, borrowing was \"affordable enough\" that it kept the working class participating in the economy.\n\nNow that the bottom fell out, the entire house of cards is at risk. The media talking heads won't say it and some business leaders are (publicly) in denial. But this is the beginning of the recession that has been anticipated for years.

I see first hand what new grads and juniors are like thanks to it (largely incapable of independent learning; the entire meme about copy/pasting from stackoverflow is actually real with coding AI in that cohort). \n\n\nBut come on:\n&gt; Kevin Thompson, a finance expert and the founder and CEO of 9i Capital Group, told Newsweek: “It comes down to economics and efficiency. Training an AI to perform tasks is much easier and more cost-effective than training a human while paying them on the job. AI executes tasks exactly as programmed at a fraction of the cost. Many employers see the value in leveraging AI for basic task management, particularly in support roles and entry-level positions.”\n\n\nAI is only “cost effective” because it **operates at a loss for the moment.** Microsoft and a few others prop the industry up and keep it “affordable” by bearing almost all of the cost. That will change. That *must change.*\n\n\nAI doesn’t execute exactly as ordered, either. It hallucinates and misunderstands as much as any person does. \n\n\n&gt; Martin Boehm, Executive Vice President and Global Dean of Undergraduate Programs at Hult International Business School, in a statement: “In today’s world, with volatility and fast-paced technology advances now common themes at work, business schools need to move beyond traditional ways of teaching. Theory alone is no longer enough. Preparing students in new ways, with a focus on building both the skills and mindsets needed for continuous learning, is the future of education.”\n\n\nGood business schools already did that. What’s your excuse, Hult? None of this is new. Absolutely none of it. It’s still as fast paced and volatile as it was 25 years ago when I entered the workforce in a corporate setting. \n\n\nSchools are supposed to connect students with employers in these instances. There’s a reason that Wharton grads don’t struggle like Hult grads. Breaking in is 90% who you know and 10% luck. After that, one can prove themselves or continue to ride the nepotism train. There’s a reason that McKinsey alumni hire other McKinsey alumni after they are done consulting. \n\n\nThe problem isn’t AI per se. AI is a partial solution to the problem. The actual problem is that businesses want fully trained workforce but don’t want to engage in any training besides minimal onboarding. \n\n\nWhen I first entered the workforce, companies would spend months training new hires. Now it’s usually a week or two, much of that just the fluff. They aren’t training actuaries anymore. They aren’t training developers. Why would they? People are flight risks and any investment an employer makes means the employee will—on average—leave for competitors in two years time for better pay since those competitors don’t make that initial investment. \n\n\nAnd so it goes.", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T17:58:51Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "technology", "post_title": "Employers would rather hire AI than Gen Z graduates: Report", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1i907sm/employers_would_rather_hire_ai_than_gen_z/"}}

The implementations varied and thus sucked to work with, but that was not the language's fault. Then some years later, in 2004, Google released Gmail. It was a fairly full featured application that just loaded in your browser, no downloads or plugins needed. Of course that was because they had the audacity to write its UI in the monkey dance language! The code was unbelievably awful, I remember looking at it and shuddering. Meanwhile the utility of these new universal \"web apps\" was obvious. Google released more web apps, proving the feasibility. Others joined in. \n\nAs the decades passed JS had a lot of features tacked on to try and cater more towards web apps and the way the language was now being used.

{"id": "kqq7zbw", "text": "The main issue is that HR at most places, even before AI came onto the scene in the past year, have largely been relying on applicant tracking system software as their primary screening for the past decade or more rather than actually viewing the resumes personally. A lot of those systems can be *really* finicky with how they interpret resume formatting, as well as what they're specifically looking for in terms of keywords. \n\nLike, if you put in a little extra work to make your resume look nice visually by formatting it differently, used \"non-standard\" subject headings or put them in a weird order, or even if the straight export to PDF was a little off and didn't tag the document correctly (which is something 99% of people aren't even going to know to check), it can lead to the ATS straight up not reading it and trashing it instead. \n\nSimilarly, if you aren't matching the language in the job description in your own experience bullet points (e.g. the description says \"Apply trend intelligence and an understanding of both historical and current market dynamics...\" and your response point was \"Applied conclusions from data-driven insights along with current and historical market dynamic context\"), the ATS could say that it's not similar enough to the language used in the description (especially if you're just slightly off in the same way throughout) and throw it out as not a good fit. Same thing applies to not including enough raw numbers or metrics from your past work (e.g. \"Increased engagement by 350% over 5 years\") - a lot of those systems look for specifics, and if they don't see any, you're out (though I'd say that adding in specific metrics is just a good practice anyways).\n\nWhen I was laid off 4 or 5 years ago, I think I had sent out 100+ resumes and gotten maybe 3 callbacks before I learned about all the right formatting stuff.

Not to mention that the most recent models becoming more and more expensive in general to develop. \n\nWith big tech not getting their AI clause through on the so called \"Big Beautiful Bill\", I can also see regulations coming to hit them, especially in blue states (and even in red, because a lot of these guys actually don't like AI either - which you'd expect given how conservative they are and how uncanny AI would be to them). \n\nLike we've been here before.

Budgets are getting tighter by customers. Many of these tack-on AI features cost extra money and the leadership in most organizations cannot justify the expense for these additional add-on features. \n\nPeople in large organizations are realizing that built in AI features into a product they buy is a risk to the organization because it entrenches their productivity in a cloud product they have no control over. Also the AI features are not targeting necessarily the use cases the business are needing to automate. You gotta buy an AI package that bundles a lot of crap you dont need with the one feature you want. It's much more economical to target specific use cases and to do things yourself as part of a larger application ecosystem. This way you don't get locked into a certain product. Organizations are losing trust in cloud vendors right now because of their tactics for trying to extract money by raising licensing costs.\n\nWe will see a different economics once the prices plummet and 12 people can run the whole entire organization and compete with the big guys.

{"id": "m2cedl3", "text": "&gt;What would a company do if it relied on AI for so many roles and there was an outage of some kind?\n\nAs in - if AWS or Azure went out? Happens all the time although not for long. When that happens your specific services stop working. So if their \"AI\" goes out - well, first it depends on what they even call AI.\n\nCustomer support/chat - it will just tell you that it's temporarily unavailable or crash silently in the browser.\n\nAutomation \"AI\" (I am putting this in quotes because 90% of the time these are handwritten by programmers or are very simple decision trees, they rarely actually utilize deep learning/large models) - you will get delays.\n\nTheir whole AWS cluster - oh, site and services temporarily unavailable.\n\n&gt;Are there other AI that would 'pick up the slack'?\n\nNo because it's not a bunch of actual separate \"bots\". It's a specific service. Say, someone wants to pay for a new PC. You might have a separate pod running machine learning model that takes into account type of purchase, credit history, location and amount and return a value between 0 and 1. 0 being \"wtf, don't lend them money\", 1 being \"a perfect customer\". If a value returned is, say, 0.9 or higher - it gets autoapproved. If it's 0.25 or lower - it gets auto-rejected. In-between cases are handled by humans. You then have your website or 3rd party integrations send requests to that service with required data and it returns that number.\n\nIf such system dies then it either stops the entire flow with an ugly exception and an influx of support tickets or it sets a default in that case - eg. a 0.5. In that case a massive queue to be cleared by humans will show up. Then once your ML system comes back online you probably write a ticket to one of your developers to take the cases between these date ranges and redo the scoring. There is no \"backup\" AI that can pick up this job however, it's one blob of code that's temporarily dead cuz a develop set too many threads and DevOps engineer assigned a whole pod 256MB of RAM or because someone screwed up the DNS again and fixing it requires 3 lines of code and 5 levels of approvals (cuz it's fintech so the procedures are leeeengthy).\n\nStill, there is a decent degree of automation and machine learning although I am not sure if calling it AI is valid - eg. getting messages to the right person (detecting a language for instance), handling simpler cases, anomaly detection (eg. if someone was making all their purchases in Stockholm and now they suddenly start making them in Paris it will probably get blocked) and a LOT of data mining.\n\nI definitely don't buy the \"AI can already do all the jobs\". If it could they wouldn't be having 5000 employees. It most certainly handles some cases and without automation they would need, say, 20000 employees but for now it's still general corpo-speak for \"please give me money, my dear investors\".", "timestamp": "2024-12-16T15:55:34Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "technology", "post_title": "Klarna CEO says the company stopped hiring a year ago because AI 'can already do all of the jobs'", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1hfli0a/klarna_ceo_says_the_company_stopped_hiring_a_year/"}}

Without human labor capital owners have no source of wealth.\n\nThis is expressed through people being unable to buy anything. It won't matter how cheap things are because people will have no money. This also applies to capital owners because their wealth comes from the labor of others. When investors see revenues drop to zero they are going to pull out.\n\nSo stop automating, right? They can't.

In fact, I've seen a lot of AI \"work\" cause more issues and grips; but no one is running around talking about that out of one on one meetings.\n\n  \nMy money is on tightening economic conditions, higher central bank rates, and easier near/off shoring all leading towards reduced entry level positions in developed western societies.

If upper management is talking about AI and reducing headcount, they're going to parrot it all day. No career front line or middle manager wants to be THAT person who is going against the grain, you'll get labeled as a problem person. As a society we give a lot more credit in the agency and independent thought space to these folks than is probably deserved. They're not bad people, they've just got family to feed just like the rest of us and they're going to say whatever their bosses want them to say. \n\n  \nThe real question is what's going to happen in 1-3 years when the AI companies all start to charge real rates plus profit margin and business consumers have to decide if it's worth the real cost.

I'm just trying to point out that blue collar jobs can be every bit as insecure as white collar jobs are, but that the causes of insecurity are different.", "timestamp": "2025-10-10T15:45:57Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "technology", "post_title": "Gen Z faces ‘job-pocalypse’ as global firms prioritise AI over new hires, report says", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1o2y980/gen_z_faces_jobpocalypse_as_global_firms/"}}
