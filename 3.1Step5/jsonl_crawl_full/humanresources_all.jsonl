Not just a 30 second sample video. Have them DO an interview, if only even a few questions, to get the true experience and see what feedback the system provides.

Would they consider that efficient and resourceful? Or dishonest and cheating? If the latter, then does the same reflect on the org if they use it on their end?\n\nEducate them on how AI recruiting tools have been found to have bias in the past. Example: “The system preferred: white-associated names 85% of the time versus Black-associated names 9% of the time; and male-associated names 52% of the time versus female-associated names 11% of the time.”\n(Source: https://www.washington.edu/news/2024/10/31/ai-bias-resume-screening-race-gender/#:~:text=October%2031%2C%202024-,AI%20tools%20show%20biases%20in%20ranking%20job%20applicants'%20names%20according,Alejandro%20Escamilla/Unsplash)\n\nCompare data about how many candidates drop out of the process at that point with regular interviewing vs AI. My guess is it would be higher and you could show you’re losing candidates.

What percentage of people who apply, complete an AI interview through this technology? How will this affect our Brand and will this reduce our candidate pool for hard to fill roles? How do you want to handle that?\n\n2. What’s the average reduction in time to hire for NON- High Volume hiring use cases with this tool? Do they even have any non-high volume customers to compare? My guess is no as the technology to support these is new (like the last 1 or 2)\n\n3. Bias! How do they comply with national and international AI laws (Colorado, New York, EU AI Act)? Are they independently audited for bias? My guess is no which leads to legal liability concerns. \n\n4. If we put this in place how are we measuring success/failure? How do we know if we should continue using this tool? What’s the timeline to determine this?\n\nAt the end of the day, software decisions are often not made by people in the trenches doing the work day by day.

But just to share, ive been running thousands of AI interviews every month for the last 7 months and what im actually seeing is candidates (esp Gen Z) are a lot more cool with it than ppl expect.\n\nThey care more abt speed and fairness than the “first convo must be human” idea. For them, getting an interview right away, not waiting 2 weeks for a recruiter slot, and doing it at 10pm if they want matters more. Some even say its less stressful cos the bot doesnt judge their accent or rush them.\n\nAlso the consistency part is big. Every candidate gets asked the same way, no bad mood recruiter, no random bias. Gen Z notices that and takes it as fairer shot.\n\nI agree rapport and culture are important, but honestly most candidates dont expect to feel culture in a first 15 min screen. They just want to get through it quick and know theyll meet a real person later. If you position AI as saving time not replacing humans, they usually embrace it.\n\nSo ya, the gut feeling makes sense, but reality is younger candidates are actually leaning in, not pushing back.", "timestamp": "2025-09-28T07:20:46Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "Need your opinion: Company wants AI to run first interviews and I’m uneasy about it [CO]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/1nnlnw7/need_your_opinion_company_wants_ai_to_run_first/"}}

{"id": "n742ngi", "text": "First off CONGRATS on the courage and preparation it took to pitch the 4-day work week! Getting a “bring me a plan” is a major win, especially when the usual reaction is fear-based \"No.\" Sounds like you made a strong, data-driven case, and that matters.\n\nTo your questions:\n\n1. Have you successfully implemented a 4-day week or even proposed one?\nYes, I’ve proposed it before (in a logistics and biotech setting), and while full implementation didn’t happen right away, we were able to launch a pilot version tied to specific teams with measurable outcomes.\n\n2. How did you handle pushback on coverage and productivity?\nCoverage is the #1 objection (totally normal). What worked for us was offering staggered days off instead of everyone taking Fridays off. That ensured someone was always available. Also, we looked at output-based goals instead of hours logged. That framing helped shift the conversation from \"time spent\" to \"value delivered.\"\n\n3. What metrics did you track to prove it worked?\n\n+Time to fill and time to onboard (recruiting)\n\n+Cycle time per task/project\n\n+Internal response time (like Slack/email or system actions in Workday)\n\n+Employee satisfaction (pulse surveys)\n\n+Absenteeism &amp; sick days\n\n+Voluntary turnover\n\n\nWe also asked managers to track “dropped balls” or escalations due to coverage gaps which, during the pilot, were NONE!\n\n4. Did it help with retention and burnout?\nYes AND No. Burnout scores dropped (we measured via internal surveys), and we saw a noticeable increase in applications when we listed 4-day work weeks in job postings.\n\nThat said, one challenge was managing meeting overload; people tried to cram too much into four days. We had to coach teams on prioritization and asynchronous updates.\n\nHappy to share the pilot plan template we used if it’s helpful for you. You’re on the right track, just keep tying it back to business outcomes and build in clear feedback loops! \n\nGood luck and I'm honestly excited for YOU!", "timestamp": "2025-08-05T20:34:43Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "Just pitched a 4‑day work week to my boss.

We also tried out a rotating 4x10 where you started Monday one week, Tuesday the next, Wednesday the week after that on repeat.

Because its government our needs and requirements are different than private sector. Every few years, we have a small group of taxpayers(ironically,  most of which are retired) who complain about it so I have to justify its continuation.  \n\nBefore switching, offices were open from 9 to 5, closed for lunch, Mon-Fri. Now we are open 730-530 Mon-Thur.\n\nThis is the synopsis of my presentation:\n\n* We track our DMV transactions and between 40 and 45 percent are done before 9 am. Customers appreciate not having to take time off work to renew their tags.\n\n*Over half my employees have taken a pay cut to come work for me 4 days. It's local government so our wages aren't that great but when I'm doing my recruitment I tout  a pension and a 4 day week.\n\n*Since the county went to 4 days, several other cities and school districts in the area went that route since it was the only way to draw teachers to our rural communities. \n\n*The first 45 minutes and the last 30 minutes of a working day are wasted anyway with people making coffee,  getting settled, etc. We are actually more efficient with longer days.\n\n* 40 hours is 40 hours, it doesn't matter how many ways you divide it. With the internet,  customers want a 24 hour marketplace but they don't necessarily expect service that way.\n\n*Your employees actually take off less time because they have Fridays to do doctor appointments and stuff. So the time they take is in larger blocks, which is easier to schedule around. \n\n*This is a different time and employers can't take their employees for granted. It takes a ton of money to train someone and if you expect loyalty then show some to your people. \n\nHope this helps.", "timestamp": "2025-08-08T16:03:16Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "Just pitched a 4‑day work week to my boss.

I know this is not the same field as you but it’s my experience on question 4. \n\nI got promoted and took over a department of 14 full time positions and about six part time per diem positions. I’ll only speak about the full time.  When I got hired the team was 8/14 full and I had one employee with over a year experience. Everyone else had quit and it was a constant issue. Even with massive shift-incentives they could not cover shifts. When I started I terminated two problematic employees rather quickly and then instituted a 4 day work week. Previously it was a 5day work week.\n\nAlmost immediately there were benefits. Staff were more likely to pickup partial shifts on their days off for overtime and morale improved significantly. Out of the 14 employees I was the only 5-day a week employee. I offered shifts based on seniority per position and nobody had any issues. 4x10hr days with one or the days being a Saturday or Sunday. No exceptions.\n\nOnce I filled the team to 14 I only had to rehire 2-3 times from people leaving and everyone who left did so for jobs that were almost doubling pay (we had a state run facility open nearby that was actively recruiting. We couldn’t match the wages). In the five years I ran the department I did not lose an employee to anything other than the state facility and from internal promotions (I always pushed my team members to do more and get it). It’s been four years since then and the whole facility has adopted 4x10 schedules and seen an unfathomable reduction in turnover.\n\nIt required extra work on my part. Missed shifts especially in the beginning caused significant headache. It required a buy in by the whole team and I had a decent group who were so burned out they we were willing to try anything.  But if given the opportunity I would ALWAYS opt for a 4x10 schedule even if it meant a slight pay cut.", "timestamp": "2025-08-08T19:25:19Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "Just pitched a 4‑day work week to my boss.

{"id": "jp4yx7n", "text": "Everything I'm about to say is anecdotal, but recently I worked for a company that was about 14K in headcount, 18 billion USD in revenue with a DEI team of 6. It was by far the largest DEI team I've worked with (I supported them mainly in analytics and reporting), and they were incredibly sharp. They were professional, practiced the DEI values they preached, and were incredibly hard working.\n\nThis team focused on fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion mainly through our ERGs/BRGs. They also brilliantly laid out a plan to invest $1 mil into local trade programs for underrepresented racial minorities to develop a workforce from scratch to fill their niche technical roles. This team was always at the forefront of HR, always presenting slick decks, and they genuinely believed in their cause.\n\nHere's my issue: even though this is the best DEI team I've seen, they are truly middle management at best. Want to improve the culture? Marketing and communications did all the actual work to create materials and distribute. Want to build a new workforce? Talent Acquisition did all the hiring and networking with the trade programs. Want to ensure diverse talent is represented at all levels of the org? Talent Management already had a robust plan to do that long before DEI arrived, not to mention the various HRBPs who were factoring in DEI into their succession planning and org development. \n\nAnd when it came time to report on metrics? Well, none of the DEI metrics were owned by DEI alone. Hiring was all on TA, representation was all on TM, any issues with OFCCP compliance or EEOC concerns fell with a separate team that did HR compliance. Equity issues in pay were managed by Total Rewards. The DEI team was absolutely stuck to find any metrics or topics that they alone could say \"yes, we did that\". That's why I was helping them with reporting; they were lost on how to actually quantify their work.\n\nThe business justification for DEI has always been weak, but the pandemic and racial tensions of 2020 undoubtedly pushed many companies to get more into DEI. But what have they accomplished? What value have they added? No one can say, especially the DEI teams themselves. It's always \"we know we're doing well\" but they can't prove it. Their success depends on dozens of other teams. Many DEI teams have resorted to saying \"this is the right thing to do\" regardless of the financial cost and impossible to calculate ROI. I don't think they're speaking the same language as executive leadership, but for a while there's been an underlying fear that corporations must care about DEI or else. It's almost like they've invested because they're afraid of the financial impact that comes with consumer backlash if the company were ever to be outed for not caring about DEI.\n\nI can't see any company wanting to expand their DEI professionals in this economic climate. Maybe they'll hire one or two to ensure they've checked the box, but there's no room to expand. DEI professionals are all building programs, but they're all nice to haves. And when the economy slows down, nice to haves are not business critical.\n\nMaybe I'm pessimistic, but even my HR colleagues who are POC, women, disabled, etc. don't see or have strong enthusiasm for DEI. It's a nice sentiment, but these teams are not delivering any real value to employees or their employers. I'm a gay man myself and I can say that DEI at every company I worked at has done nothing for queer individuals. It seems many other diverse individuals share the same critical take as me: DEI has a much smaller role in companies than we were led to believe.", "timestamp": "2023-06-22T20:30:08Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "What areas of HR do you think are most high in demand vs oversaturated?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/14g909n/what_areas_of_hr_do_you_think_are_most_high_in/"}}

{"id": "jpcy95r", "text": "I think DEI works best with companies that fall on either end of the headcount spectrum. In the smaller companies, they have more ownership of projects and goals because of the lack of size in the HR team. I don't think many small organizations are focused on DEI, though, because smaller companies tend to focus on other business aspects.\n\nOn the other side of the headcount spectrum, I think it is easier for DEI to demonstrate its value in a larger organization because of the size of that organization.  There is a reason a company like NBC Universal/Comcast would put a heavy emphasis on DEI.  On the one hand, the size of the organization makes it a little harder for DEI initiatives to be split up amongst the other HR functions.  On the other hand, companies of this size always have a bunch of different projects and partnerships that involve DEI.  I can attest to the latter because NBC's DEI team invited individuals from my company when we first partnered with them on a project.  But, aside from my anecdotal example, NBC Universal sponsored a number of initiatives around Indigenous films and script writing programs, and the DEI team was at the forefront of these initiatives.\n\nI do agree that there is little to no value in a company like in your example, as all the things a DEI team would do are already typically handled by other teams.", "timestamp": "2023-06-24T15:43:29Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "What areas of HR do you think are most high in demand vs oversaturated?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/14g909n/what_areas_of_hr_do_you_think_are_most_high_in/"}}

{"id": "k28ja3l", "text": "You’ve been so meticulous in listing down your requirements - it really helped me understand better and narrow down the options that can truly cater to your needs.  \n\n\nNow, stepping into your shoes, I can totally understand the kind of ATS/CRM system you are envisioning.   \n\n\nIt seems like you are looking for a tool that's not just robust but also intuitive and doesn't burn a hole in your pocket, especially given the scale of your operations. Correct me if I’m wrong.  \n\n\nGiven your detailed criteria, I'd recommend you explore **Recruit CRM**. It's a platform that has been gaining traction for its user-friendly interface and a plethora of features that align well with your requirements. Here's a brief on how it matches up to your checklist:  \n\n\n**Centralized talent pool:** Absolutely, it allows you to have a centralized database where you can manage all candidate information seamlessly, be it from job posts, spreadsheets, or imported resumes.  \n\n\n**Keyword filtering:** You bet! It offers a powerful search functionality where you can filter candidates using keywords across all data fields, making your search process a breeze.  \n\n\n**LinkedIn Recruiter integration:** It facilitates smooth integration with [LinkedIn Recruiter](https://recruitcrm.io/blogs/what-is-linkedin-recruiter/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=reddit+organic+syndication&amp;utm_campaign=011-+HIKQuestions), allowing you to import complete profiles, including the detailed sections like experience, education, and even inMails and notes.  \n\n\n**Managing duplicate profiles:** It's equipped with features to identify duplicate profiles and gives you the option to merge them, ensuring a clean and organized database.  \n\n\n**Profile enrichment:** Yes, it assists in enriching profiles to provide a comprehensive view of each candidate.  \n\n\n**Communication tools:** It supports seamless communication with applicants through inMails and emails, both individually and in bulk, akin to what Gem offers.  \n\n\n**Tracking communication:** It keeps a tab on all your communications, helping you track the candidates you have contacted efficiently.  \n\n\n**Sourcing passive candidates:** It's adept at sourcing passive candidates from job boards, offering both manual filtering and AI-driven instant sourcing.  \n\n\n**One-click job posting:** It allows one-click posting to free job portals, saving you time and effort.  \n\n\n**Automated shortlisting:** It automates the shortlisting process for candidates who have applied to job posts, making your job much easier.  \n\n\nI hope this helps you set the right tone.   \n\n\nHowever, please remember - the best advice often comes from peers. So I'd recommend reaching out to fellow recruiters who have used this platform to get a firsthand account of their experience.  \n\n\nWishing you the best in finding the perfect ATS/CRM system for your needs!", "timestamp": "2023-09-26T03:38:00Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "ATS/CRM (Applicant tracking system and candidate relationship management) suggestions", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/134qvvg/atscrm_applicant_tracking_system_and_candidate/"}}

The companies will suffer due to their third parties or vendors using different platforms, or major issues with audits due to clerical errors. Data entry comes back for some companies but by that time the AI agents are actually competent and entry level actually gets removed again for good, and it’s progressively coming for mid-level roles. Then shortly after you’ll have general intelligence ai type agents that will solidly eviscerate entry level and will come for mid-level. \n\nFor the employees this should work like a word processor, making our lives easier as you say. This will be the case in the very immediate timespan of whenever the AI’s are released to the general public use or commercial use (like what we have now with ChatGPT). What’s more realistically going to happen is the demands on the laborers will grow and the ability to get jobs, and experience will become sparse; the jobs will be eliminated. Entry level will be more and more technical, higher and higher education and experience required. There are no roles in HR that are *actually* automation-proof, people cite the human stuff like you did but that’s largely office admin speak and not grounded in reality. You’re not accounting for workplace conditions getting worse in favor of profit over functionality (the recent waves of tech layoffs are reflective of this — major websites have functionality issues but the companies don’t care). Unfortunately a company operating at all with a lower headcount is more profitable in the immediate term than the better outcome of not reducing headcount for long term health and better long term profits.\n\nThis isn’t science fiction or anything, think about the last time you bought a calculator. You don’t need to because it’s on your phone. This functions the same for buying the hours of a laborer. \n\nApologies for the essay I think about this all the time!

There are some aspects of my job (compensation - not position analysis or payroll) that I WISH could be replaced by some sort of system because it’s just annoying to work with. We have tried to build our HRIS to work through the different comp channels and 9/10 times it’s incorrect and we have to do it by hand so we’ve ditched trying to automate those bits all together. \n\nBenefits? An AI probably doesn’t care if you can’t get your prescriptions because of fault on the you or employers part for not sending in information to the company. It probably also doesn’t understand that your deductions are incorrect, even though that’s exactly what you’re telling it. I have to work closely with my benefits team because our system moves FTEs down to benefit ineligible statuses automatically and, while it’s doing it’s job, it can’t tell Benefits that these people will be benefit eligible again by X date so they shouldn’t send that drop in coverage email. \n\nComp/position analysis - we have tools (PayFactors, etc) that help us, but the reality is that so many jobs aren’t exactly the same and need to be evaluated on an individual/company basis to really determine how to price positions. In a large company, this would still require a full team to tackle several departments and thousands of employees on a yearly basis. \n\nEmployee relations - might be able to set up a system to check for legality, but it needs a human network. You ever call an automated line and can’t get anywhere because the AI can’t figure out what you want? This whole section would become a nightmare on both the employer and employee side. At some point we would need a human to listen to the conversations and it would be a huge waste of time and money if we’re paying for an AI to analyze conversations, but then also having to go back and listen to the dialogue.

{"id": "jqmbmhy", "text": "As an HR professional, I appreciate your question about the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on our field. While AI is indeed being integrated into various HR functions, it's important to have a nuanced perspective on its potential implications.\n\nAI can definitely enhance efficiency and accuracy in certain areas of HR. For instance, in recruitment, AI can assist with resume screening and candidate matching, making the initial selection process more streamlined. Additionally, AI-powered systems can simplify benefits administration and provide self-service options for employees, making it easier for them to access and manage their benefits.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to remember that HR involves more than just data and processes. Our role extends beyond transactional tasks and requires human judgment, empathy, and strategic thinking. While AI can offer data-driven insights and support decision-making, it cannot fully replace the value we bring to employee relations.\n\nEmployee relations is a complex area where understanding the nuances of human behavior, emotions, and context is essential. While an AI bot may provide guidance based on legal rulings and policies, it may struggle to navigate the intricacies of individual situations and provide the necessary human touch. Our ability to build relationships, mediate conflicts, and foster a positive work environment is irreplaceable.\n\nMoreover, HR encompasses strategic aspects that involve long-term planning, talent development, and organizational culture. These areas require our expertise in understanding the unique needs and aspirations of employees, aligning them with organizational goals, and fostering a thriving work environment. AI can provide recommendations based on data, but it lacks the creativity and vision that we bring to shaping organizational success.\n\nRather than fearing the rise of AI, we should view it as a tool that can augment our capabilities. By leveraging AI technologies, we can automate repetitive tasks and focus on higher-level responsibilities that require critical thinking, creativity, and relationship-building. This allows us to bring more value to the organization and focus on strategic initiatives that drive growth and employee engagement.\n\nIn summary, while AI will undoubtedly play a significant role in HR automation, it cannot replace the unique skills and insights we bring as HR professionals. It's important for us to adapt and embrace AI as a tool that enhances our efficiency and effectiveness, while we continue to provide the human touch that makes a real difference in the lives of employees and the success of our organizations.", "timestamp": "2023-07-04T11:13:26Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "Will AI make most HR functions irrelevant in the near future?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/107lxum/will_ai_make_most_hr_functions_irrelevant_in_the/"}}

I’d say go with seekout if you’re struggling more to find the right kinds of profiles, but go with gem if you’ve already got a good sourcing thing going but need really robust messaging campaigns that can by customized more for each candidate. Note that because gem’s campaign function is more robust, the reporting around those campaigns is also more robust (for example, if you provide a link in your message you can see how many candidates clicked the link, and run A/B tests on which links drive the most engagement). This is not to downplay Seekout’s insights, which are also really cool, but way stronger on sourcing and market-related reporting, and has cool diversity insights too, but is much weaker on the campaign reporting (only really has open rate, reply rate, and bounce rate). I chose to go with Seekout over Gem because I could only choose one, and I do think that was the right call, but it’s very frustrating you can’t individualize messages except for a limited number of tokens (name, candidate’s company, day of the week—that kind of basic stuff).", "timestamp": "2022-08-06T20:09:27Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "Reaching out to potential candidates using cold email/messeges", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/whrlq4/reaching_out_to_potential_candidates_using_cold/"}}

Sounds like they won't be a competetive business for long with that mindset.\n\nRPA/AI, as well as different recruitment aids however, can make the process easier. But why not try this? 1) make analysis of the roles that you most often recruit for, then let that information (it should be vast and deep)  lead to an easy to read specification that you make an attractive add from, create questions that needs to be answered when applying (it helps with a first assessment, should eliminate personal letters, and have to be based on the specific profile). This will give you an easier time with a first selection, as well as improving the predictive validity of the process. 2) use these profiles, with some to none changes whenever they are used. 3) use some sort of testing (G-test, personality assessment etc). 4) have a good template for interview questions 5) create or buy a good competence model and use it 6) educate your recruiters in basic IO regarding recruitment (traps, structure VS no-structure, employer branding etc) 7) train recruiters in interviewing (MI etc).\n\nOr... Just adress it as something bothersome and see the effects. But yeah.. RPA/AI for the parts that could be automated. Like a first selection (do you have x? Yes/no, if no, move to \"doesn't meet our specifications\" if yes, move to \"selection 1\" then manually to through selection 1, or send out tests (depends on what's most important to the specific recruitment project).\n\nShort answer: I'm extremely sceptical.

That kind of exposure is hard to gain without first being part of a firm.\n\nAs for executive leadership programs, I don't think it would be too late to pursue one later on. At this stage of your career, the coursework might not fully resonate with you, and your classmates will likely be further along in their careers. That could make networking more difficult, since you may not have as much to offer in terms of shared experience. Strong programs also tend to prefer candidates with more substantial professional backgrounds.\n\nI hope this doesn't come across as discouraging, and I want to acknowledge that you may be really good at what you're doing right now.

You don't want to miss the stars, and the more you depend on filters, especially key words, the more you miss. What better investment is there to make in your company than building the best team you can? \n\nScreening interviews are also not productive. Make the call on resume and cover letter. That isn't to say the first contact can't be from HR or an assistant but the purpose of that call is to answer questions of the candidate and schedule with the decision maker.

HR is mostly individual contributors.   A lot of the job is having conversations that managers are scared to have.  Everyone starts at the very bottom. Every function except training and development is high stress, and training and development is the first function to get cut after recruiting during down times so that comes with its own stress.

You need to be very confident in yourself and your decision making to work in HR, and while you can absolutely learn how while on the job, it takes awhile.

I’m an HR Director at a nonprofit and I’ve been in HR for something like 13 years. \n\nThere’s no single answer to any of your questions because of the huge variety in HR positions, organizations, etc. You definitely need to do some internships where you’ll have a lot of guidance at first and help get your foot in the door. It’s not glamorous, it might be glorified admin work. Your first job won’t necessarily be orientation and it’s highly unlikely a company will let someone brand new do terminations because there’s an art to it and legal ramifications. Lots of people start out as HR Admins where the job might look a lot like an Admin Assistant within HR and work their way up. And yes, you can use notes to do orientation! There’s no such thing as average pay because it depends on so many factors but spend some time Googling to see what’s out there. \n\nEverything gets easier with practice. Onboarding &amp; orientation, data analysis, employee relations, even terminations. The first time I had to do a termination I had to leave the room to throw up! I never use AI because it’s counter to my own personal values, but I use our HRIS daily. \n\nHR is a very hard job. There’s no way around that. But some HR jobs are better than others. For instance, you might really love learning &amp; development or something like HRIS and hate recruiting or employee relations. You won’t fully know until you try but you likely have some idea of what you like and what you’d be good at. \n\nBurnout is real. Boundaries are key. I highly recommend learning project management or something that teaches you how to prioritize and budget time. \n\nIf you’re not in therapy, get there. It will help immensely. There are sliding scale therapists out there if you google that. \n\nTo be very honest, if I had the choice again, I would not choose HR.

{"id": "ianmzkd", "text": "Allright back for my follow-up because I did not forget.\n\nSo - since the law does not clearly dictate qualification of the third party auditor, and generalizes at disparate impact. In my opinion the language is going to shift to not requiring third party, as the burden is likely going to shift back to the city if they are requiring the audit. They would need to setup a system where audit summary will be submitted as the final version of this regulation. Kind of like EEO reports. For now - the key practice right now until that guidance or changes does come is to prepare the following:\n\n1. Look at all the software and cloud process involved in your hiring functions. All of them. You need to identify what software and steps are actually impacted by the law. \n2. Figure out how to audit your records. You likely already do this. You just need to add in tracking and record retention specifically related to data regarding hires made affected by these processes. \n3. Review contract with your vendor for any 3rd party ATS or HRIS in case it needs to be updated for this law. I would contact them anyway. They are preparing for this as well and will have more direct information that impacts you as their client. \n4. Identify what characteristics in the \"automated decision making\" impacts candidates ability to be viewed, screened, etc. that could impact protected classes. \n\nGather data, wait for guidance, contact your vendor for a meeting about the changes.\n\nIllinois HR professionals should be doing the same. \n\nAdditionally - again - this is coming far and wide.

{"id": "nljk46t", "text": "I think you’re misdiagnosing the problem. To me, it sounds like the real problem here is that you’re imposing excessive and unreasonable expectations on your candidates. Interviews are extremely stressful, especially in our current economy where the entire world feels like it’s falling apart and we’re on the brink of World War III. You can’t reasonably expect anybody to be relaxed under these circumstances. Also, the way someone responds to stress in an interview is completely different from the way they respond to stress on the job. When someone is job hunting, they are in a position without economic security, which automatically makes them more stressed out then they will ever be on the job. You shouldn’t be testing for “emotional intelligence” or personality types, anyway. That’s Social Darwinism, which is just a skip and a hop away from eugenics, fascism, and ethnic cleansing. (Real Darwinism is the opposite of Social Darwinism). The only thing you should be testing for is technical ability to do the job. You need to allow candidates to have low or non-existent EQ. Stop testing for it.\n\nThere’s a book I think you ought to read titled *Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us* by Daniel H. Pink which explains that workers only produce their best work when they’re being paid enough that they feel economically secure and aren’t thinking about money. What this means during the interview process is that you will never see a candidate’s best work during an interview because the economic insecurity of being jobless makes them mentally incapable of doing their best work or showing how they’ll actually perform on the job.\n\nEDIT: Here's another post from a Reddit user looking for a job that highlights why your methodology is flawed:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/InterviewCoderPro/s/CHYxtWHlEO", "timestamp": "2025-10-26T21:07:23Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "I'm Tired of Interviewing People Who Are Great at Applying for Jobs, But Terrible at Doing Them.[N/A]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/1oe8him/im_tired_of_interviewing_people_who_are_great_at/"}}

Optimized résumés and keyword strategies can easily make an average profile look exceptional on paper. That’s exactly why the role of experienced recruiters and talent partners has never been more critical.\n\nHere’s how we can address this gap in our hiring framework:\n\n1. Human-led pre-assessments: Before any formal round, we prioritize brief, structured conversations to gauge self-awareness, curiosity, and communication tone things no AI can quantify.\n\n2. Scenario-driven interviews: Instead of rehearsed Q&amp;As, we use contextual “day-in-the-role” situations. It helps reveal how candidates think, react, and collaborate under realistic pressure.\n\n3. Collaborative evaluation: We include team members from different functions in early interviews.

On newer versions of windows, this will have the file name automatically highlighted (without file extension highlighted)\n\nCTRL + C = Copy text (e.g. copy my file name template)\n\nCTRL + V = paste (to paste my copied \"file name template\")\n\nCTRL + X = Delete highlighted text and copy it (e.g. oops. I didn't mean to rename that file to that. Let me copy that name I originally gave it so I can paste it into the file it's supposed be on)\n\nCTRL + A = highlight all the textssss\n\nCTRL + left/right arrow key = navigate through text by each word (instead of each letter. This one is a GAME CHANGER.)\n\nCTRL + HOME key = highlight text between where your text cursor is and the LEFTmost spot\n\nCTRL + END key = highlight text between where your text cursor is and the RIGHTMOST spot\n\nALT + F4 = close current window (e.g. closing a PDF after confirming what the contents are before you rename it)\n\nALT + TAB = switch windows/programs. Tip: hold ALT and tap Tab to toggle/cycle through the different windows you have open \n\nALT + SHIFT + TAB = same as the previous but you cycle backwards through windows\n\nThis is all I can remember off the top of my head.

{"id": "n539qy3", "text": "I’m an HR Generalist for a manufacturing company of about 200 ppl across two locations. I’m in charge of all the recruiting and go through resumes every day. \n\nMy first pet peeve is seeing resumes that are just awful to look at. Fat paragraphs, clearly made by an AI, or just formatted so horribly that it takes added effort to see where the hell they worked. \n\nSecond pet peeve is people listing every job they’ve ever been at in their life, including ones they worked at for a month. Why would you include that?\n\nThird pet peeve isn’t resume-specific, but a pet peeve nonetheless: A large chunk of the candidate pool is filled with folks on unemployment (that want to STAY on unemployment), and so they either:\n\nA. Don’t provide work history at all, or\nB. They accept &amp; confirm the interview invitation, then on the day of the interview, some “emergency” comes up. Daughter’s in the hospital, dog died, pipe in apartment burst, anything you can think of. They then ask to reschedule; I give them the benefit of the doubt (even though I know what they’re doing), and then on the day of the reschedule, they ghost me. Sometimes people ghost on the first interview. It’s a flawed system. \n\nAll in all, I can feel my brain melting in real-time whenever I go through resumes. Some people just don’t have the slightest bit of understanding of how to apply for jobs correctly.

If you're not talking about HR in a strategic way, you should be. If you're not demonstrating value in your job, you're doing it wrong. HR oversees the most expensive asset in any company, the people. HR has a ton of sway with senior leadership and is apart of senior leadership at every company I've worked at. Stop acting like all HR does is admin work.\n\nAutomation and integration is the area in which HR has the most room for improvement, in terms of technology. This will probably affect some admin, coordinator and other entry level positions negatively, but that's not new. Payroll used to be an extremely manual process and required a large team. Now, with payroll tools, payroll admins can handle much higher volumes per person. \n\nAI is a tool and it should be used as such. We should be very, very wary of using it for things like compensation, recruiting and trainings. AI has been discriminatory, gives illegal advice and makes stuff up. Giving AI access to sensitive employee information is something companies need to be careful about. Some cities/states/countries have already banned use of AI in certain HR areas.\n\nFor recruiting specifically, AI resume screening can be hit or miss and is easily gamed by candidates right now.

Recruiters like it because they don't waste time on basic prescreens and can focus on quick responses at the end of the funnel. Instead of a month long process, hiring can happen in under a week.\n\nWhat's really happening is AI is fixing parts of the process humans already broke. Ghosting, endless form-filling, bias, and scheduling headaches. For tradespeople or shift workers, being able to take an interview after working hours or on the weekend is game changing. For recruiters, it means more time spent on genuine conversations with qualified candidates instead of burning hours on repetitive admin (especially now with AI job applications).\n\nI think the end game of AI in HR is Candidates will tell their \"agent\" they're ready for a job search, employer agents will vet and negotiate, and humans will just do a quick final interview with 3-4 companies. What used to take months could be condensed into a week.\n\nThis shift is not just anecdotal. A recent study with 53,000 applicants randomized into AI-led vs. human-led interviews found:  \n\\+12% more job offers  \n\\+18% more job starts  \n\\+17% higher 30-day retention  \nAnd when given the choice, 78% actually chose the AI interviewer\n\nPaper here if curious: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MLZ\\_3hnWxr1J2wvosMWHs-f5IBCN8Coy/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MLZ_3hnWxr1J2wvosMWHs-f5IBCN8Coy/view)", "timestamp": "2025-10-03T03:06:46Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "IS AI is going to eliminate HR jobs… or finally prove HR’s value?

En revanche, cela devrait libérer du temps afin que les équipes RH puissent se concentrer davantage sur les personnes, pratiquer l’empathie, etc.\n\nJe partage plutôt ce point de vue. Il existe encore trop de tâches profondément humaines dans les RH qui ne pourront pas, à court ou moyen terme, être remplacées. Les chatbots, par exemple, ne peuvent pas gérer efficacement une discussion sur une transition de carrière, car la dimension émotionnelle y est trop importante.

We've got a separate HR dept from the Payroll dept that creates and writes our policies. But when they affect PTO, LOA, or employee pay well its payroll who has to answer and then enforce them. Not HR who wrote the policy to begin with. Like why do we need rules on how a person uses the PTO granted to them? If its not affecting their overall measurable performance there's no need. If it is affecting their measurable performance why are you not coaching managers on how to have those necessary performance conversations instead of making it everyone else's problem? I had an employee freak on me the other day because they used 2 days of their sick time in a row and per policy their manager demanded a doctor's note to justify it. I empathetically agreed with the employee that its stupid and demeaning to reveal to a superior if not all of HR that you have a mental health condition or an invisible disability that needs to be \"verified\" by a doctor in order to take a mental health day as an hourly or salaried employee. It paints a target on your back.\n\nAn unjust law is no law at all. Its why I dont enforce this policy within my own team and have vocally advocated against it with higher ups.

Every other Monday, I'm ready to smash my computer to smithereens because ADP cannot handle 106 of us trying to process payroll by the 11am deadline and b)if the employees made an effort to clock in &amp; out correctly and take their lunch break on time. Tomorrow afternoon, since payroll closes on Saturday, I will get an email from my regional director addressing all the missed punches and meal premiums. Every morning I go in and wave the meal premiums for those who have a waiver and worked under 6 hours but we have 16 legit meal premiums this pay period, 3 of which are for the same employee who has NO excuse for not going to lunch on time. And has anyone with a meal premium turned in a late/missed meal form? NO. Has anyone turned in missed punch correction forms despite me asking them to? NO. So tomorrow I get chastised. And at the end of the month at our monthly HR teams meeting, my location will not get a shoutout for having under 10 meal premiums. We will get a shout out for meeting the other 2 metrics so that's that but this meal premium crap is horsesh*t and not my fault.\n Wait. Who am I kidding? I'll never like payroll. Never. Every freaking week, someone is my office turning in vacation or sick leave requests from previous pay periods. Or complaining their check was short and when I pull up their time card, it's because they clocked out for lunch one day, didn't clock back in and didn't clock out at the end of their shift. How the f*ck am I supposed to catch that? Or because they didn't turn in their PTO request on time.\n\n-job fairs and onboarding after a job fair. I just can't with the impatient people who call the next day even though we tell them offers will be sent out in 48hrs. Or the people who drag their feet and take days to come in to get the paperwork for their livescan and physical &amp; TB test. Who are told to pick it up ASAP and to get it done ASAP (if they need extra time, no problem they just need to let us know!) but they don't start either one for over a week! I've got 12 in the pipeline and have had to follow up with several of them more than once, to see if they still want the job because they haven't  even started the physical or background check. And then IF they get their sh*t done, I'll have to figure out how to get them all in for their Relias trainings when we have 4 training computers and I'll have to make sure they show up on time every day and monitor their progress and connect them with their director towards the end of their Relias training, when I have my own direct reports and am the sole HR for 112 soon to be 120 employees and this is just a small fraction of what I do.

{"id": "ls7mu1f", "text": "I’m going to politely disagree with the one column folks. As someone who works on the TA side of HR, I actually like this format. One, it shows you have an underrated skill of knowing how to format a document (even if it is a canva template). Also, I might only be looking at your resume for 6 to 10 seconds initially, having it formatted this way shows me your relevant experience and education side-by-side, right at the top.\n\nHere some other suggestions:\n\nLose the profile piece. I never read them and largely they just take up space IMO\n\nSince you’re applying to HR Jobs, name your work experience “ Relevant Experience” or even “Human Resources Experience”, take your internship out and it move it down to the bottom under a new heading “additional experience”. You could also add other work experience you have here, as well.\n\nMove your Education up to just below your contact info, I think after a few years (and jobs) then you can move it back down. Could you expand your education? Like did take any HR classes that you could callout as relevant coursework?\n\nPersonally, your skills section isn’t that interesting. it’s just words that don’t really mean anything to me. I would move web skills up and call it skills. You’re looking for HR Jobs? Cool, I want to know which HRIS or ATS you’ve worked with before and if you have any other tech skills as well. That information is way more relevant than court room etiquette. You have bilingual skills? Amazing! That should go right below. I agree with another commenter, lose the icon and use a descriptor: beginner, intermediate, advanced, fluent, or native speaker. If you’re stronger at reading/writing you could also break that down. And then if you have the space you could have “additional skills” at the bottom for the others.\n\nLastly, something to consider: you did get 4 interviews, so your resume is obviously doing something right, right? That’s data you can use. What do those jobs have in common? Are they smaller companies? Should you be targeting your search to similar jobs? And then taking it a step further, what happened in the interview? How can you improve your interview skills to get the job?Your resume is just the first step and while its success may feel limited, you are getting some interviews out of it.\n\nGood luck!", "timestamp": "2024-10-16T15:11:54Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "Can’t find an HR Job [CA]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/1g4wpnz/cant_find_an_hr_job_ca/"}}

My previous company initially hired employees through a staffing agency, which was later acquired by the company and transformed all employees into full-time employees. This change resulted in gaps in many of my employees’ background checks after the call center was closed. I’ve had several former employees reach out for help when searching for new employment.\n\nAnother factor to consider is whether this person has had any health issues in the past that could impact their timeline. Personally, I’ve experienced difficulty recalling specific timeframes (months, years, etc.) after being involved in a severe car accident that caused a traumatic brain injury (TBI). In March, I was laid off as part of a reduction in force from a remote-based logistics company. While updating my resume, I realized I had entered incorrect dates from my previous position at the aforementioned employment agency/call center. Since I had moved multiple times in the past decade, I lacked the necessary paperwork to verify the timeframe. My old resume was lost due to a computer crash, and I hadn’t backed it up, so I had to start a new resume from scratch. It wasn’t until a background check for a potential new employer that this issue was brought to my attention. I genuinely believed the provided timeline was accurate. I wanted to share this perspective since it wasn’t mentioned earlier.

Not always the case but if they say they “run lean” or “wear a lot of hats” it can mean they’re not appropriately staffing and expect you to pick up the slack from functions that they haven’t bothered to dedicate workforces to. If they say things that allude to high turnover and don’t have a lot of tenure in their department - I.e. if there are multiple HR vacancies and/or the most “senior” of their staff has been there for only a year or two. On the opposite end of that, if everyone has been there 10+ years, they’re not going anywhere and there’s likely less career advancement opportunities for you, so I would expect you would need to look externally eventually if you wanted to progress in your career. Also, sometimes those kinds of employees may not be open to change if they’re long-term so expect pushback if you try and do things differently.\n\nThere are more but again, easily Google-able for “red flags to look for in interviewing” or whatever.

{"id": "gc3oyd1", "text": "I am at one of five facilities across the US for my company. The laws across the various locations vary as you known, and our corporate has done their best via consults with legal and medical experts to formulate policy which applies to all. We've got \\~330 employees at my facility, and we've had 7 cases of covid since shut down out of all our employees despite our county being the state hot spot for a while now with cases still increasing.\n\nAt the start of covid we gave the employees each 1 pack toilet paper, 1 canister disinfectant wipes, 1-12oz hand sanitizer, 1 can disinfectant spray, and 1-3 oz pocket hand sanitizer. Each month we give out another pocket hand sanitizer or one package of disinfectant wipes.\n\nInstalled temperature scanning cameras at entry points. They work maybe a little too well. I and the rest of our local covid team get an email photo with temperature of the culprit every time someone walks in carrying a hot cup of coffee. It also picked up someone running a fever so it does work at least.\n\nRandom employees are stopped and asked a set of health questions daily at entry. \n\nAll visitors are temperature checked again using a touchless forehead thermometer and asked a series of health questions.\n\nAll applications for employment are online now with the first interview being a phone interview. As part of the phone interview we get them through filling out a web form for their background check. Their first entry to the building is often for orientation. A few key positions we have done interviews which were held out on the break room patio.\n\nMask policy currently is you must wear a mask any time you might come within six feet of another individual. You can take it off alone in your office or a control room with the door shut, or while driving around on a fork lift or out on the yard driving the yard truck. Mask must be worn in the entry / exit hall at all times since usually many employees are entering / leaving at the same time.\n\nWe provide hand sanitizer and disinfectant sufficient for all reasonable uses in the facility. Even down to providing disinfectant wipes or spray for cleaning forklifts. Whenever anyone needs a pen it is wiped with a disinfectant wipe or sprayed with disinfectant spray between users. Most of our documents have gone digital with covid questions being done on a pad with disinfectant used on it between users.\n\nWe also moved an extra person to cleaning duties during each shift. All break room and bathroom surfaces are cleaned with disinfectant 3x per day. In addition all offices and spaces are being treated with special lights once per week. Even those offices only entered by the occupant. Certain large equipment which is shared like supervisor golf carts and bikes is sprayed down with disinfectant between each shift. Forklifts are sprayed down twice a week.\n\nThe doors for all the bathrooms were removed and replaced with a screen system so no one can see in. Doors to certain shared areas like the break rooms were also removed. The main front entry doors are propped open for each shift change and break. We did allow offices to keep their doors. No one is supposed to touch anyone else's door other than knocking to allow those in offices to put on their mask before opening the door to admit the person who knocked.\n\nOur break room seating consisted of small 4 top tables inside and metal tables with benches on four sides outside. Chairs were removed inside along with a notices posted only one chair / person per table. Outside 3 of the four bench seats at each table were marked do not use and additional chairs were placed outdoors. Net result no one need sit within 6 feet of anyone else. Employees have been told being caught sitting with anyone else is a final write up. Thankfully haven't had to write anyone up.\n\nWhen we find someone has tested positive we go back to their last day at work and trace their movements via our security camera system. We notify anyone clearly exposed they need to go for testing. Currently it has been determined clearly exposed equals any time they've been within six feet of someone else while either party wasn't wearing a mask.\n\nWe also pay people who are off reasonably for covid exposure with the pay coming from use of sick time and short term disability funds. We have had a couple of people off twice for two weeks but that is dwindling as we now have the rapid test in our county. \n\nPrior we sent them for the test, then the county put them on two week quarantine for most known exposure cases with them testing a second time prior to returning. With the new rapid test the county is largely releasing them to return to work with a negative test. They only miss 2-3 days with that due to the county taking that long to get round to testing them now.", "timestamp": "2020-11-13T00:03:36Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "Q: Any HR professionals who work for companies that have large manufacturing facilities?

{"id": "h2j3lsd", "text": "I had a similar experience.  I was seeking director + roles and was having a tough time.  I suspect that the higher you go the more stiff the competition.  \n\nHere are a few things I did that helped: \n- Hired a resume writer (who also helped with my LinkedIn).  I had been out of the job market for over 12 years and really didn’t know what people do these days for resumes, cover letters and LinkedIn.  The fresh look really helped.  \n\n- I started customizing my resume to match the job description more closely.  I used jobscan to help with this.  However, don’t make changes so dramatic that your LinkedIn and resume conflict each other.  People check and won’t give the benefit of the doubt if the 2 don’t line up. \n\n- I wrote a personalized cover letter tailored to the company - showing I did my research about them and included enthusiasm about joining them in achieving their mission.  Some will say this is BS to do a cover letter. I hate cover letters (giving &amp; receiving) but it seemed to help me get more calls. In any case, as long as you aren’t too sales-pitchy or desperate, cover letters can’t hurt.\n\n- I stopped holding out for a remote role. There is SO much more competition for these jobs (AND companies will usually focus on candidates in areas with lower salary costs).  I think it is easier to get a local job and then negotiate partial work from home at the offer stage. \n\nAll of the customizing made job hunting tougher and a lot more work, but I got a job.  It wasn’t the perfect job but I’m 50-50 remote, and it pays the bills!  \n\nThere are some good suggestions here for things you can do.  I was reluctant to utilize my network (I felt like I was asking for pity) but once I did it was amazing how people showed up wanting to help.  I didn’t ever directly ask for job search help, but rather asked if people would critique my resume and from that a lot of people started referring me around to their contacts.\n\nEDIT:  One other major observation I forgot to share. I noticed that I was getting invited to continue in the process with more interviews when I was directly talking to my prospective boss (Head of HR or CEO) in the initial phone screen.  With phone interviews where a peer or subordinate level HR person or in house recruiter was the interviewer, they usually did not result in any further interviewing steps.

So in your case if you're already going 120% by their standards then you're doing a lot but you may also be making someone else look bad.\n\nOther school says put in your time and work hard you will be noticed and given more projects to level up your experience and potentially get promoted. Again you will be rewarded for being good at your job by being given more work. Not necessarily a bad thing just one method is a bit more pessimistic than the other.\n\nI've never been a fan of recruiting but you can also work on succession planning if that's part of your purview.

I also eliminated task-based, passive language where I could and replaced it with more big-picture descriptions that showed how I improved things rather than just listing the tasks I did. Enough employers use tech to filter through resumes and cover letters so if you don't have enough HR buzz words, you'll get passed over.

{"id": "nm96ln4", "text": "HRIS Director here and I respectfully disagree. Sure, maybe some companies/job postings for an entry level analyst will require a Workday Pro/admin cert but I would argue most do not. The analysts I've hired had core foundational experience from People/Talent Ops, or Reporting &amp; Analytics etc. - I didn't need them to have prior HRIS experience since its an entry level role. What was most important was foundational knowledge and experience from within HR (HR processes, basic reporting etc.).\n\nOP: I think you have a solid foundation for an entry level HRIS role (analyst). The bulk of what an analyst does is basic reporting/analytics, data auditing, understanding and building workflows, general system troubleshooting etc. You can learn the systems and foundations of HRIS/governance from a manager or mentor. I don't expect an entry level analyst to know all of this on day 1, if its truly 'entry level'. I would highlight the technical things on your resume (workflows, automation, reporting) and perhaps ask you to expand on it (for example, I am not entirely sure what you mean by 'coordinated' the data between ATS and HRIS - but perhaps you were in some way shape or form involved in assisting with an integration/automation for this data flow then I would mention that instead). Wouldn't hurt to take the Workday Basic series training although wouldnt say its required by any means. Other areas of focus I recommend are AI and Automation - tons of basic/intro to AI trainings and certs out there (e.g., search Elements of AI training), you can look into basic Power Platform (power apps, power automate, power BI). If you have access to Power platform in your current role, I would think about basic use cases for it and include that on your resume (e.g., using power automate for automating a recurring email for example).", "timestamp": "2025-10-30T20:22:56Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "Resume review for breaking into HRIS?

{"id": "nleja6h", "text": "As others said, you need to emphasize (and develop) your technical skills more. I’m not trying to downplay your experience at all, but the way most HRIS are setup almost anyone on an HR team can manage data and documents in an HRIS. If a company is hiring an HRIS role externally they are most likely looking for strong technical acumen and already have a coordinator/assistant to enter data and pull reports. So you need to gain experience building workflows, implementing automations, integrations, system testing, etc. and demonstrate an ability to translate HR needs/requirements into technical ones for configurations. In your current org, who on your team manages or works the closest with your HRIS and ATS? Can you speak with them and express interest in getting more hands on with your systems? Becoming a power user of the systems you’re already have access to is a good first step. While I can’t speak to HR data roles, for HRIS I wouldn’t recommend getting any certs with the sole purpose of getting your foot in the door. Just like in other areas of HR, experience is king.\n\nIf you really have to leave your current company your best bet is probably an internal move into HRIS. Tbh, most HRIS people I know who were external hires (including myself) have at least an educational or professional background in IT/IS, or were very heavy HRIS users for a long time in a previous HR role. Look for coordinator and maybe some specialist roles that aren’t directly HRIS but emphasize working closely with the HRIS in the job description.

I completely revamped the handbook; created workflows for internal recruiting, onboarding, and offboarding; moved all off our onboarding into esignature form; redesigned the performance appraisal system so it has checks and balances; I spent three weeks on doing a cost analysis of different HRIS so we could move our forms out of Google Drive and into a reliable automated system. \nI was excited (albeit nervous) to have the chance to build an HR department in what was basically my 3rd year of work.\n\nWhen I say “zero follow-through”, I mean that I get told that trying to implement these changes wouldn’t be worth it. The only one that would even cost money would be purchasing an HRIS. I tried to bring up offering a 401k and better parental leave and got laughed at, This place is so unorganized that the person who was previously handling onboarding had no idea where anyone’s I9s were when I tried to do an I9 audit.  I frequently have to reissue offer letters because a hiring manager will want someone to start ASAP and the new hire will end up wanting to give two weeks notice. I expect high turnover now because hiring managers will select whatever candidates can be lowballed and are willing to start ASAP, not who has the best fit. I brought up the idea of having an interview guide with a rubric that would help with the process and I was told “we don’t have enough time for something like that, we need to move fast.”\n\nEveryone who I’m trying to get guidance from is so focused on their tasks at hand that I feel lost on what’s expected of me, and when I ask them I just get told that they need a new hire so I should focus on recruiting for that. \n\nI’m tearing up writing this because I feel so completely unsupported and lost.

{"id": "j8mw0ek", "text": "Professionally I’ve had a rough road with HR especially since Summer 2021. Had an interim manager in our 1:1s bring me to tears, tell me I wasn’t cut out for this, and when I disclosed at home abuse and a learning disability due to long haul covid I was slapped with a PIP that nearly killed me. I passed the PIP, only to find I was being laid off 6 months later. \n\nJob after that hired me for 2 months told me I was the right hire, good culture fit, was doing a lot without direction. Got great feedback from the CFO who I rolled up to. Then they hired the VP of people shortly after. 2 weeks later I’m told my decor is kiddish and to not put on slack “almost the weekend”. A week later I was placed in a tag up came with 3 pages of things to talk about. Was told I’m being termed instead. “Poor performance, culture fit, several concerns that cannot be left unpunished”. That shattered me. \n\nOf course finally, last job the c suite bullied me and degraded my work to the point they locked me out of critical systems for 5 days without reason or notification before terming me at will. I was reporting labor issues too. Now I’m in a legal battle. \n\nSo you see it hasn’t been easy and I was really hoping that getting my SCP would assist in finding a place that would actually take the time to invest in me and not just do what my last 3 employers did. I honestly don’t know what else I can do at this point in life besides HR. There’s a lot of trauma I’ve been working through with a very special therapist as it’s incredibly complex this whole thing. \n\nI did try to answer the questions like SHRM would, or how a CEO would, but alas nope.

{"id": "niizuuc", "text": "If they're a candidate who doesn't make it to interview, always give the polite rejection email. Spend some time making it more human and less formulaic. \n\nI always love adding a tid bit (as long as it's aligned with the culture of the firm) something like: \"it's a small world, and even smaller in the field of finance! We hope you'll keep in touch, and if there's ever another position that you feel is a perfect match, do not hesitate to apply again\" or something along the lines of: \"even if it's a no now, it may not be a no forever\". \n\nAgain, only if that fits with the vibe of your company. I'm pretty personal in my tone as a recruiter. \n\nFor the ones who interviewed, give a real, personalised rejection. Being safe legally, not really giving anything away, but you can still give a light compliment, such as: it was so appreciated the way you followed up with kind regards after the meeting, such professionalism is a wonderful quality in any candidate! We hope you'll stay in touch, and if it's ever the right time, with the right role, we hope it might just work out.\"\n\nIf they were terrible, don't lie or flatter just thank them kindly for taking the time out of their busy day to come into the office/take the call/etc.\n\nBasically... Do everything you can to keep them wanting more, really loving the firm, and speaking highly of it to others. You never know who they are connected with, can speak highly or poorly of their experience and that can save devastating ripple effects to your company's perception! \n\nSo... Long story long... Personalize as much as possible. Be careful and follow the law, and never put your company at risk, sadly we cannot really ever give genuine (hard) feedback, without putting the firm at risk..I don't make the rules..

Expect to not only see a rise in it but that it will be the new normal.  How will your hiring processes adapt when every applicant looks like it was specifically targeted to be the exact perfect match for the job?\n\nCan you answer why should any applicant put in time to fill out a resume in their own words to your job when in the same time a service can put that application in to a few thousand jobs with key word optimization to ensure their resume passes all the filters you have in place ?  \n\n‐----\n\nSame text above ran through chatgpt as if it were an hr professional counciling a new hire in hr:\n\n \nChatGPT\n\nAs the Chief of Human Resources with over 40 years of experience, I'd like to discuss a simple and convenient filtering technique we can implement in our job ads. To minimize spam and automated resume posting, we can include a unique instruction at the bottom. Specifically, we can request applicants to begin their resume with the word \"giraffe.\"\n\nHowever, we must carefully consider the potential downside of this approach. While it helps reduce unwanted applications, we may unintentionally filter out candidates who possess valuable qualities. For instance, we might miss individuals who are quick to adapt to new technologies, have a genuine passion for learning, and actively seek out ways to improve efficiency through automation.\n\nIt's important to recognize that artificial intelligence (AI) and technologies like ChatGPT are rapidly becoming an integral part of our world. The proverbial genie is out of the bottle, and we can expect their prevalence to increase. In fact, it's likely that tailored applications, perfectly matching the job requirements, will become the new norm. This poses a challenge to our existing hiring processes.\n\nGiven this context, we need to reflect on why applicants would choose to invest their time in crafting personalized resumes for our job openings. After all, there are services available that can quickly submit their applications to thousands of jobs, utilizing keyword optimization to ensure their resumes pass through any filters we have in place.\n\n\nAdditionally, as an organization, we should strive to create a hiring process that goes beyond filtering for keywords. By incorporating a holistic assessment of candidates, including interviews, practical assignments, and reference checks, we can ensure that we not only find the most suitable applicants but also identify those with exceptional adaptability, a passion for learning, and an inclination towards automation.\n\nIn summary, while we can introduce a simple filtering mechanism, such as the \"giraffe\" word requirement, we need to be mindful of the potential drawbacks. The rise of AI and tailored applications will require us to adapt our hiring processes accordingly. By demphasizing the value of personalized resumes and implementing comprehensive assessments, we can attract candidates who possess the qualities we value and ensure a successful match between their abilities and our company's needs.", "timestamp": "2023-06-19T01:46:19Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "AI Resumes", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/14a490o/ai_resumes/"}}

The admin stuff you mentioned is just the tip of the iceberg honestly.\n\n\n\nWhat we're seeing work really well is AI handling the truly painful parts - like automatically parsing resumes in different languages and formats, matching skills across different certification systems (German apprenticeships vs US trade schools etc), and most importantly, navigating all the visa/work permit requirements automatically. That last part alone saves our clients like 15-20 hours per placement.\n\n\n\nThe interview notes thing is pretty solid already with tools like Otter or even just ChatGPT for cleanup. But where it gets interesting is when you start using AI to actually pre-screen candidates based on specific criteria, especially for roles where you're dealing with language barriers or different qualification standards.\n\n\n\nOne thing I'd be careful about though - the \"full blown AI agents\" are mostly still pretty overhyped. Most of them work great for simple, repetitive tasks but fall apart when you need nuanced decision making or when dealing with edge cases. We've found the sweet spot is using AI to handle the heavy lifting on data processing and initial screening, but keeping humans in the loop for anything that involves judgment calls.\n\n\n\nFor international stuff specifically, AI is honestly a necessity at this point because the compliance requirements change so frequently that no human can keep track of everything across multiple countries.

Studies show that AI (at least those of its iterations that were available a few years ago) is partial to white male job seekers simply because it is based on selection choices that were previously made by humans. And again, it's both analytical and predictive because recruitment is about trying to do both at the same time. So, obviously, AI as a prediction tool is deleterious to diversity because of a diversity-validity dilemma, i.e. the higher the predictive validity of an assessment tool, the lower the diversity of selection. Therefore, it may seem that being assessed by AI is the poorer choice.

Unfortunately it's easy for leadership just slap \"AI\" on a process in the name of \"efficiency\" without really considering the workload or risks behind that statement. Particularly in this situation, a policy like this has the potential to create way more work that just doing things \"the old fashioned way.\" \n\nWholly aside from your very justified concerns about de-humanizing the process, I would have very real liability concerns about this. Several states are implementing restrictions around this area that will likely add quite a bit of burden and/or risk to the use of AI in this context. Texas has a law coming in January. Colorado has one taking effect in February, New York City is already there, and California is in the process of finalizing regulations on it. I would expect other states to follow suit. Obviously, all those laws will be slightly different, but they do create a set of common questions:\n\n* Most of these laws require that some form of anti-bias audit be conducted periodically. You will need to create a policy and procedure for that. Is your department resourced appropriately for that extra work? \n* That begs the question - if you have to conduct spot-checks of the system anyway, is there actually a real time savings vs. just doing it yourself in the first place?\n* If an audit discovers a bias, what's the game plan to fix it? If the problem is with a 3rd party vendor, *can* you even fix it? This is a particular concern given that a lot of AI is just a black box and the vendor may not be willing to share (or even really understand) how their system actually works. For example, if it's conducting interviews with some sort of speech recognition, how does it handle ESL candidates or candidates with speech impediments? \n* With new laws, there is a tendency to spawn a ton of lawsuits, at least initially. Is your legal team cool with that? Does you leadership understand/even care about the extra potential for liability there?\n\nIn sum, I just don't know that the juice is worth the squeeze here. If your leadership is dead set on this course, I would at least look to loop in the legal department, since this has the potential to blow up in their face, too.", "timestamp": "2025-09-26T15:38:00Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "Anyone else uneasy about AI job interviews?

To maintain culture in these changing times, IBM takes a employee centric view and is focused on providing transparent communication, opportunities for collaboration, purposeful work, feedback, continuous learning and skilling for our employees. Covid-19 has been a forcing function and in many ways an accelerant to the acceptance of work being performed remotely.

Keeping people empowered and motivated is an ongoing effort - no matter where they are located.

Whether initiating more frequent communication or fostering productivity, technology and the use of cloud allows us to maintain relationships and engagement in ways that were previously impossible.  It can also be used to support personalized, just-in-time learning and skilling which are key factors in engagement.  Thankfully, all of this is already part of IBM's culture so there was not a need to change our remote working policy.  It is worth noting that it's a bit early for companies to have changed their remote working policies -- the COVID-19 forcing function of employees working from home is an accelerant to the acceptance of new ways of working and the possibilities for the future.

{"id": "fpys5p8", "text": "Thanks for the AMA.\n\nThere's probably hundreds of takeaways from this discussion, but I do feel that one key going forward has to be building a more robust and adaptable resource management paradigm that proactively embraces interdepartmental and small-group needs.\n\nTechnology has already become so much a part of our work life that one has to address very specific and actionable elements in order to remain relevant. New opportunities, often in the form of crises, arise unpredictably and organizations need to be mobile and flexible enough to respond and adapt -- notice for instance the exponential rise of Zoom in the past few months, something probably not foreseeable even a year ago.  (Doubling its market value and likely rendering it a tasty prospective target for Google, perhaps.)\n\nHR always needs to remain cognizant of its role to be in service to specific organizational and departmental needs, but to otherwise maintain its appropriate background role, while reinforcing requisite ties with legal and regulatory departments in regards to complex, ever-changing, and often contradictory employment laws across global jurisdictions.\n\nWork-at-home is certainly a huge issue in the current time frame, of course, and HR needs to be cognizant of the dangers of the central organization encroaching upon workers' non-work lives, a far greater danger than the opposite that organizations usually seem concerned about (decrease in the ability to micromanage it what this concern often camouflages.)  Questions may be raised, at some point, about the dividing line between employee and independent contractor, when many more employees can now control their own schedules to a greater degree.\n\nLarger organizations may even be able to strike a balance between work in office and remote work, by providing the equivalent of coworking spaces or minimally-equipped satellite offices, where remote work or \"work at home\" employees could have access to basic requirements (desk, supplies, fax/copier, high-speed connections, etc.) , closer to their homes, in a more widely spaced out interior plan (for social distancing) and with relatively lower overhead than the official corporate office.", "timestamp": "2020-05-09T07:14:51Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "I'm Amy Wright, Managing Partner for Talent ＆ Transformation at IBM.

There’s the greeter at the door who checks receipts.\n\nMy husband was at Walmart yesterday and said they had removed self checkouts at our store.

However since 2020, people in general are so much more aggressive and frustrated, I'm seeing way less emotional intelligence. Which leads to so much conflict. A job that was difficult (for the reasons you noted) is becoming untenable. Employee relations as far as the eye can see, even reasonable accommodations are started in acrimony.

You're not wrong that it's changing, but that's true of most industries.\n\n&gt;Do you see the field improving or getting harder?\n\nI think it'll be different. A serious concern I have in HR , especially with younger professionals is their inability to develop relationships. I've noticed a lot of people who retreat to an office and aren't willing to make themselves known or available to colleagues. \n\n&gt;How do you see AI shaping our roles in the next five years?\n\nProbably more tightly integrated by default. At a past role we had a phone system that would auto flag recordings for coachable moments. Managers would bump this up to HR and we'd start the process of formally logging the incident. \n\nI foresee a lot of that. I also foresee LLM like you mentioned generating a lot more emails , newsletters and so on. I have a pet theory that eventually someone will feed a LLM some big piece of sensitive data and a bad actor will use prompts to sus out that data and it'll trigger some huge piece of crackdown/legislation. Either that or the wild west will be opened. \n\n&gt;What do you wish you had known before you started?\n\nI had an experience where I fundamentally changed a young woman's career and it was all sunshine, rainbows and puppies. That moved me from management to HR. \n\nI really wish I'd have been made aware of how bad it feels when people in a toxic culture run from you. I remember in a retail setting one person fucking off to pretend to work EVERY TIME he saw me. But I also wish people would have prepared me for how good it feels to turn the corner with those people.\n\nThis isn't a hard HR thing but we all have that one fucking person who thinks you're their personal HR team and shrink and your phone rings off the hook or you roll your eyes when they're coming.

However, I agree with the majority of responses here - I don’t believe it’s an immediate threat. \n\nI do, however, want to touch on your statement regarding discrimination. First, AI/ML has shown to be considerably bias in decision making. The spectrum of bias broad, based on a variety of elements but namely the learning model that was used to train the algorithm. While AI is great at identifying patterns and executing complex processes far faster than any human, it’s important for any organization that’s considering using AI for decision making to remember that ML algorithms are developed and trained by humans and, therefore, are not perfect. Recent research on this topic has brought much attention to it and many leading AI developers are working to reduce and mitigate this bias as much as possible. \n\nThe DOL very recently released a Q&amp;A/recommendation letter that addressed this very specific topic, specifically related to companies relying on AI to help with hiring decisions. Interestingly, while they acknowledged that bias by AI certainly exists in these processes, they didn’t take a hard stance against it. Instead, they encouraged employers to work with their respective AI platform to ensure the ML algorithms are designed to mitigate bias as much as possible. They briefly discussed the two leading methods for identifying bias (4/5ths rule and statistical significance) but did not directly indicate which method they would apply to such claims and charges. \n\nAI is a tool used to (hopefully) help make better and faster business decisions. However, companies are ultimately responsible for all employment practices and actions they take, including fair and ethical hiring. While AI is a hot topic in the HR sphere right now, it’s imperative that employers fully understand how it works before implementing practices involving AI that have the opportunity to impact employment outcomes.", "timestamp": "2023-05-28T00:15:38Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "Is compensation analysis going to be yet another job that's taken over by AI?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/13t4928/is_compensation_analysis_going_to_be_yet_another/"}}

{"id": "noi82jl", "text": "I agree. There's a big difference between outsourcing all your thinking to a tool or using the tool for non-value added tasks than using it to enhance or assist the work. By outsourcing Slack messaging to the bot, you are effectively making everything less efficient and training away your communication skills. They will atrophy. When I see that, I immediately think what will the employee do in a client meeting or when asked something impromptu without the ability to use AI.\n\nWhat I've come to the conclusion of is that AI benefits can be measured on the same bell curve as performance. Those high performers who have strong domain knowledge and experience use it for efficiencies sake and to enhance their tasks. The average typically like to outsource the work that they deem less than valuable or automate time-wasters. The underperformers? Well, they just turn in the AI's work and hope that no one's any the wiser. We are. But still, on paper, it looks like they are performing better.\n\nThe same can be said about performance in specific areas. If you have confident communicators, they tend to only use AI to make things more concise or understandable. Perhaps tailor it to a lay audience. If the communicator is self-conscious and/or lacks strong skills in that area, there is more of a chance that they will attempt to use AI to cover up that weakness. It becomes a crutch. I've seen it show up in the same ways you have. Things like only AI responses, reports that say a lot without saying anything, out of context replies that reek of lazy prompting, etc.  For someone in performance and learning like me, those are huge yellow flags.", "timestamp": "2025-11-12T19:20:21Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "Rant: Employees excessively using AI [N/A]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/1ovdyma/rant_employees_excessively_using_ai_na/"}}

Your typical 9 to 5 doesn’t really exist for us. We don’t have standard daily schedules like 8 am to 5 pm or 9 am to 6 pm. Instead, we use what’s called a “forfait jour” (a day-rate system). Basically, there’s no such thing as overtime, since working hours aren’t defined. So depending on your workload, it might be 35 hours/week, 40 hours, 50 hours, and so on. So when you start your day, you never really know what time it’s going to end.  \n\nNow, yes, there’s a legal “right to disconnect,” so technically you’re not supposed to be working at 10 pm but in reality the “long-hours culture” is still very strong. Meaning a lot of people stay later at the office because it’s seen as a sign that you’re dedicated and willing to go the extra mile. Even if that same person took a 2-hour lunch break and had five coffee breaks during the day.  \n\nThat’s the complete opposite of what you see in many other European countries, where if you’re still at the office after hours, it just means you don’t know how to organize your work.  \n\nIt’s slowly changing with the younger generation.

I have anxiety and I tend to get in my own head about work if I don’t set strict limits for myself, so answering work messages when I’m away from my desk is a one way track to burn out for me. He didn’t push back, but I could tell he wasn’t impressed. My coworkers then revealed they do the same thing and do not check their emails or teams notifications on their days off. \n\nEventually, my boss realised he was getting nowhere with trying to contact us outside of work, we were unavailable and unreachable and there wasn’t really anything he could do about it. I’m very firm with this boundary. I once even reported someone to HR for messaging me on my personal WhatsApp about a mistake I’d made at work. He did this on my sole day off that week, so I wasn’t about to tolerate that behaviour. Everyone aged 35 or under in my office has this same boundary. As they move up through the corporate ladder, they’ll soon implement those same boundaries as company policy. \n\nI do understand the argument that certain individuals, like CEOs or other high level managers, should be available in case of emergencies. However, most people aren’t in those roles. I also understand the argument that international teams should be able to communicate, but I do think there are ways around this. For example, if a business operates in the US and in Europe, maybe there could be a day or two each week when the US team arrives to the office earlier in the day for more overlap with the European team? I genuinely think constant availability is a one way track to burnout, and there are plenty of ways around constantly being available.", "timestamp": "2025-09-05T10:07:54Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "Should we adopt France’s “no work calls after 6pm” rule?

{"id": "nclmfk4", "text": "I'm the founder of an early-stage startup and work-life balance is an ongoing challenge. As a smaller company in which each employee wears multiple hats, it's almost unavoidable that situations will arise where emails after 6pm or on weekends happen. Our software is also available across multiple countries, so we get support requests at all hours of the day. \n\n  \nWith all of the above said, I would suggest:\n\n1. Setting expectations is critical. If the job is likely to involve some 'outside of normal work hours' emails or calls, that this should be communicated up front.\n\n2. Adding as much automation as possible to minimize the need for extra calls and emails. For example, we have a bot to help respond to support requests when we're offline. While not perfect, it at least lets customers knows that we've received their support request and sets an expectation as to when we'll be able to get back to them. It also proactively proposes other resources they can refer to to potentially resolve the issue themselves. (Note, I totally understand that this wouldn't apply to an over-zealous boss who emails their employees at all hours of the day)\n\n3. Be sure to show appreciation to employees when work outside of normal work hours. Here I'm not referring to over-time pay. But at our company, we do let employees accumulate over-time hours and apply those to extra paid vacation days. We also use an employee recognition tool that lets managers and employees recognize others for going above and beyond. It's surprising how well most people respond to a simple thank-you. They respond even more strongly (most of the time) to a thank-you that comes with a little reward attached. (Check out the employee recognition tool we use at: [https://www.qarrot.com/](https://www.qarrot.com/)\n\n  \nHopefully, these thoughts are helpful. You can't always avoid working outside of regular work hours, especially when you're a smaller or earlier-stage company.", "timestamp": "2025-09-05T18:26:26Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "Should we adopt France’s “no work calls after 6pm” rule?

{"id": "ncdpful", "text": "&gt;I was recently reading about France’s “right to disconnect” law, which basically makes it illegal for employers to call or email employees after a certain hour (often 6pm) unless it’s an emergency.\n\nThat is not how the French \"right to disconnect\" law works. It esbtalishes no rules about when work can be done. Instead it requires *employers* to establish some kind of agreement with, or charter for, their employees that defines what \"right to disconnect\" looks like in their company. That way, companies can take into account things like emergency work, late night shifts, and working across multiple time zones.\n\nDo I think this policy would improve work-life balance as actually written in French law? Not really. I live in the U.S. and many companies pay lip service to this - that they want you to have good work-life balance, that you don't have to respond to any mails when you're not working, etc. My company has encouraged orgs to write 'team agreements' about what hybrid work looks like and what core working hours are; in my experience it really changes nothing about the team itself. Teams that want more work-life balance will write relaxed agreements and continue working the way they always have. Teams that expect you to dedicate your life to the job write their agreements more carefully, in a way that *looks* like they embrace flexibility and downtime on face but really exist primarily as a CYA document. (In one of my previous roles, I had to write one of these.) The real expectations are communicated verbally and through modeling. \n\nThe law as written allows companies to write in exceptions for urgent issues, so no issues there.\n\nI'm going to treat #3 as a question of happiness rather than loyalty. I think most people would be happier at companies they can truly disconnect from and recharge after hours and on weekends. Even when I do *choose* to work on a weekend or after hours, I rarely want to actually talk to anyone, and I don't expect people to answer me at those hours. The past jobs I have enjoyed the most and stayed with the longest were definitely the ones where work didn't creep into my after hours.", "timestamp": "2025-09-04T14:34:28Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "Should we adopt France’s “no work calls after 6pm” rule?

I also feel like my gut alignes with what you’re saying but I can’t find anything to support that argument and I need the codes from any of the government agencies to support the argument that adult dependents who are also employees cannot be charged their portion of the premium. \n\nBecause the IRS changed the laws on QSEHRAs in early 2000’s there is a requirement to have a calculation of EE premium and then the difference for a child, spouse,etcetera.\n\nI can’t share the companies. I read a few benefit packages for those companies. I’m sure you can understand why I can’t share. Why I didn’t follow those benefit programs was because they are medium sized, over 1k employees and up to 5k. This company is four people. \nSince they are under 50 and then 100 they dont have the same two requirements but it looks like their aren’t restrictions for any sized company for adult dependents, and their portion of their premiums.\n\nI just finalized my review and I feel like there isnt anything isn’t anything showing on the IRS site or ACA that says you cant do this.\n\nI thought maybe S corp attribution for children might disallow, but it only requires medical benefits to hit the employees/ child(s) w2, if a child or spouse. \n\nWhen the employee signs their offer and handbook which outlines the benefits offered and deductions for employees they agree to the terms which make them eligible. The rules are not between the dependent and the carrier in any dependent relationship its an ACA mandate so even if the child has no clue they were added they have protection and in some cases liability. \n\nI thought maybe there was something in the employer shared responsibility provisions but there isn’t a definitive answer, and they mainly go over the 95% measurements for offering coverage. They go over laws on setting up clear guidelines to ensure the types of coverage is offered across the board. If different types are offered they need to be consistent across the board.\n\nSince carriers go off of IRS,ACA and \nQualified Small Employer Health Reimbursement Arrangements for eligible small employers (QSEHRAs) then they wouldn’t dictate a rule outside of the government rulings or they’re breaking the law but I will still look into it. I thought maybe a PEO might have some restrictions but they still needs to follow the law too. \n\nI honestly feel like my brain is melting on this but I learned sooo much, especially about S corps.\n\nIm going to check Anthem, BCBS, and maybe one other large carrier, just in case but all the tax and gov.

HR has absolutely been moving toward modernization and process automation for a long time, especially in organizations that invested early in ERPs or strong HRIS infrastructures.\n\nWhat feels different now (at least from where I'm sitting) is the *pace* and *accessibility* of automation and AI. Ten or fifteen years ago, most HR teams had to rely on major system overhauls, long implementation cycles, and big budgets to modernize workflows. Today, even smaller teams with limited resources can automate parts of recruiting, onboarding, knowledge management, data cleanup, or communications without needing enterprise-level projects.\n\nI don’t think that replaces strategic HR at all — if anything, it puts more pressure on us to operate at that level. But I do think there’s still a significant gap between what’s technically possible today and what many HR teams are actually doing. Not because they’re “archaic,” but because the tools have evolved faster than the function’s skills, mindsets, and structures.\n\nI also agree that diminishing returns will eventually set in *for the administrative side*.

{"id": "ggjc4es", "text": "Obviously. \n\nWhat I’m concerned about is the ethics of this type of monitoring. Of course monitoring is something that is gonna happen at any workplace, but going this extreme points to deficiencies in the management capabilities of a manager. If they’re not able to see that an employee is falling behind or struggling, that’s on them and HR should be intervening with that. Observation to this degree feels like overstepping. \n\nJust seems very yikes to me.

{"id": "ggktlrj", "text": "I actually did some uni work related to employee monitoring and ethics, so I feel like I can chime in!\n\n\nI agree that monitoring employees raises several ethical concerns. The thing is though, the severity of such concerns all depends on how it is implemented.      When doing such monitoring, privacy should arguably be your first priority as I believe that many ethical frameworks you could apply could be argued to be of less importance.\n\n\nI agree that a manager should be equipped with the skills to signal when a direct subordinate may become 'isolated' from the rest of the team. However, more practical examples I've seen were not looking at communication within teams, but rather across teams. \n\n\nSuppose two teams form highly interdependent chains in a process, you'd want them to be connected to a high degree. Say only 5% of people from both teams are actually communicating a lot between teams, you could see potential issues arising. ONA is able to provide you with such insights, whereas a manager may not be able to grasp these connections fully.\n\n\nOf course you would have to be sure that what you're capturing with an ONA actually represents communication between employees sufficiently. That is to say that if you're only using email data, you may be neglecting communication in person or by phone for instance and thus you may be signalling deficiencies in communication that may not necessarily actually exist.", "timestamp": "2020-12-21T11:39:04Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "Organizational network analysis to understand employee relationships", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/kh19id/organizational_network_analysis_to_understand/"}}

That'd help in being able to make recommendations.\n\nSome software tools may offer a considerable amount of lift, but come with a lot of need for implementation time, training and adoption. Though realistically, I still find myself \"building\" many tools (between dashboards through workflow management tools and spreadsheets).\n\nThe most effective thing to do is to start thinking in systems yourself. In other words, if there is a repetitive task, try to identify all of the common pain points, then minimize their impacts.  (Ask, \"Knowing that I may need to solve this problem again (or many times over), how would I approach this problem at the outset to create a process to make it better).\n\nFor example, at my company, like all others, there are certain forms that all new hires need to sign. Traditionally, these would need to be printed on paper, then signed by the employee, then signed by a company official, then digitized and saved to the employee folder. End to end, this process usually takes 15-20 minutes chunked up into little 2-3 minute blocks as I'm seeing it through.\n\nKnowing I'd need to go through this process 50 times over the next year for one of the common forms, I invested \\~2 hours in optimizing a digital process through a digital signature tool. Now, I only enter the new hire's name and email, then the entire form populates, with a scripted email explaining the form, then sends to the company official automatically (along with reminders until done), and then I receive a ready-to-file digital copy. The end to end process likely takes 3 minutes now while also increasing the quality and oversight. The two hour investment netted me 8+ over the last year.\n\nOtherwise, don't be afraid to be human. Let new hires know that there may be bumps, prime them to be flexible and understanding.\n\nFWIW, I don't think chatbots offer a tremendous amount of lift.

Things like reusing old or existing requisitions to pull certified eligible candidates for new openings vs creating a new req. \n\nTo the front line recruiter this makes things easier (don’t have to create and enter a new req!). Reporting wise, this results in the existing reports that analyze time to hire/time to fill based on a reqs open and close date end up being garbage. But recruiters are still expected to report “metrics” so they’ve created a shared Excel file where they attempt to track it. Don’t even get me started on the data quality problems or the fun of integrating those spreadsheets into our reports.\n\nI’ve seen PeopleSoft systems implemented where none of the existing reports work, because the system implementation didn’t consider reporting needs. As I was told “we decided we would worry about reporting requirements after go live” 😑\n\nAnd then you’ve got your execs that want “dashboards” and “pretty” reports. Or “snazzy” visuals. I’ve seen charts that look like a stack of pool noodles that really disguise rather than highlight trends… because the exec thinks they look “less judgmental”\n\nI’ve seen metrics and dashboard design tasks be delegated to people with no experience in this domain, because managers think it’s merely a matter of creating some colorful pie charts on a slide.\n\nThere’s a great need for data literacy in the HR field. And the willingness to see and use data as a resource and tool vs seeing it as an onerous task and source of punishment. In some orgs this requires deep cultural change. Until then it will continue to be technology that is paid for and underutilized.\n\nThanks for sitting through my Ted Talk 😁\n\n/gets off soapbox", "timestamp": "2024-01-11T14:49:09Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "What are your honest opinion or views about all technological tools-products-services mushrooming for HR?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/19320j0/what_are_your_honest_opinion_or_views_about_all/"}}

{"id": "kh982jr", "text": "My company just ran our first payroll through paycor and they went more or less all in on the product, getting as many modules as they can. \n\nIt’s got some amazing capabilities tbh. And it’s been surprisingly user friendly. \n\n\nNow the big question is, can I find the time to build what my managers need in here or learn it well enough to train them on it?   And then, will the managers have time to learn and use the various functions it offers? \n\n\nIn theory, yes. In the long term. It’s going to take a lot of time.   Im fortunate in that they went all in so instead of having ten different softwares, it’s one software with ten functions. That makes it easy for the various functions to communicate. \n\nThey could only do that because it’s a small company. \n\nMy last place of work was a lot larger and they were also in the process of implementing a new payroll system.   That system, as it turns out, doesn’t play well with the POS system they use that also manages their RFID cards. It also doesn’t play nicely with the training program they use so they are switching to a new one. \n\n\n\nMy general point is that a good clean system that works is fantastic but stuff doesn’t exist in isolation.   Which is where the problem lies. A system is amazing but it needs to be maintained.

I am not sure if this is exactly what you are looking for, but we offer our portfolio companies (and anyone else) a completely free applicant tracking system called Talent Tracker.\n\n\n\n[https://talenttracker.io](https://talenttracker.io)\n\n\n\nIt makes it very easy to manage candidates from first application all the way to hire. You can post unlimited jobs, track applicants in one place, and keep your process organised even when hiring volume increases.\n\n\n\nIt supports multiple users and roles, lets you add pre-screening questions to filter out irrelevant candidates early, and allows custom evaluation flows so you always know where each applicant is in the process – first interview, second interview, reference check, and more.\n\n\n\nIt is free, simple to set up, and you can invite as many hiring managers as you like. No complicated setup needed – just create a free account and you can be up and running in minutes.\n\n\n\nWe originally built it for our portfolio companies but made it public because it was too useful to keep private. Many organisations now use it to streamline hiring. Since it costs very little for us to run, we are not focused on monetising it. Maybe one day, if hundreds of thousands of users join, we might add a paid plan, but for now it is free and will stay that way.\n\n\n\nCould be worth a try – sounds like it would save you a ton of time and make things easier to manage as a one-person HR team.", "timestamp": "2025-09-26T15:06:00Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "ATS Recommendations for Small Nonprofit (No HRIS, 40–50 Employees)  [HI]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/1ki3fn7/ats_recommendations_for_small_nonprofit_no_hris/"}}

If platform users aren't actually logging in to use the system, that is the larger conversation, not to mention you're wasting money on a very expensive piece of software. \n\nCombine this with intuitive dashboard reports for users to show which candidates reside in specific bins, interviews they have set up for today, interviews set up for later this week, etc.\n\nIdeally, they should be able to log into the platform and have their entire day laid out in front of them:\n\nLast in 'Name of Status' &lt;is&gt; This week\nLast in 'Name of status' &lt;is&gt; Last 72 hours\n\nSet up scheduled reports to email a report to an email address or group of email addresses to show \"here are all the people that were placed in 'Name of Status' in the last 48h' or \"Here are the people currently residing in the 'Pre-employment checks in process' status. This is a great way to get information to people without them needing to be logged into the platform. \n\nYou can include all sorts of Person, Job, Recruiting Workflow data points on the report so their contact information can be produced on the report, you can include the last contact note that is on their profile, etc.\n\nDo you have Connect? If so, you can get really creative with email campaigns for some automation. \n\nTake some time to use some HTML to make emails look nice, the stock email templates are trash and leave much to be desired. There are plenty of resources for free/paid HTML templates, just copy/paste your HTML code into the HTML area within an email template and edit. (Not specific to Connect, you can use HTML in almost all email templates)\n\nDo you have Text Recruit? Drip campaigns are legit and can automate text messages to candidates as well as send follow up text messages if/when they don't respond. Not to mention that texting is the new email, we consistently see 80%+ response rate on text messages, wayyyyyyyy better than emails.\n\nMany times I see clients simply bombard users with too much info.

Part of my job was to go through resumes to hire people to build the team. I went through between 800-1,000 pre-screened by HR resumes/portfolios per month, every month, for my entire time there. I'm not HR, I was just a sr. level worker in a very specialized industry, so I had to do my work while doing those resume/portfolio reviews. After all that time and all those people applying, we hired 8 or 9 of them. In my industry, 4-5 interviews is relatively standard, especially for certain roles where you are going to be working as a hub between 3-5 departments. Back in the day after a couple phone/skype interviews, they would fly you to the office if you were out of state, and have you interview for 2 days straight for about 10 hours each day and meet 30+ people in sets of 3-6 every hour for the whole day. After every group, there was a 10 min break and the outgoing crew would sit with the new crew coming in and review notes, figure out follow up questions, and vote on whether to continue the interview or not. Sometimes applicants would only be there for 2-3 hours the first day and then be gone, that never happened to me. I always had to go through the 2 full days, but only twice (out of about 8-9 of these) did I not get an offer.

I am now way overqualified for what I do, but I do feel valued, I don't have to handle the really yucky hr stuff like harrassment and discrimination cases, but my boss sure does lean on me for advice. I can sleep easier at night but I am still emotionally connected to my work which can be a balancing act in HR. I love what I do, but having a good work life balance can be difficult in HR as we sometimes can't help but bring it home with us. I recommend doing a pro con list to see if it's really a bigger benefit for you right now, and know that nothing is forever. I do miss the money but I definitely don't miss the stress, and to me it's workable to have less money for less stress.

{"id": "la8lp88", "text": "In 2020, I took a $20k pay cut after being laid off to work at a company I was really excited about in a role that could be seen as a step back (focus was employee experience and onboarding for our big hiring initiatives — about 150 within one year for a company that was at 150 headcount). Since it was 2020, the role was fully remote but I lived in a tiny studio so I tried to go to the office a couple times a week to mix things up (bonus that it was 15 minutes away). \n\nAfter 2 years I left that company for my current company and I’m now making $30k more than I was in 2020 working as an HR dept of one with a longer commute but still have work/life balance that works for me. \n\nSo I don’t have any regrets because it led me to something really great. Things were a little tight financially for those two years, but it was one of the better decisions I made in my career.\n\nETA: I shared this perspective because we really don’t know where we will be at five years from now let alone one year. So just because you take a cut now doesn’t mean another opportunity that you consider better won’t present itself. Sometimes you need to focus on what you need to be happy if the pay cut won’t be that detrimental to your expenses and lifestyle.

We have a former union welder who is a temp  worker  who brags about formerly  traveling the country and working 12 hour days 7 days a week. Now he owns his own shop, but hates the uncertainty of this work. He is trying to get on permanently as a Warehouse worker at the local utility I work at  which basically pays  him per hour what his union welding job  paid minus traveling the country looking for work. He had a wife and kids, and initially seemed like a really good person. \n\nAnyways, he was initially very friendly, then he started acting like an entitled smart ass. He is a 1 year temp contract worker but he could be hired permanently if he just shut his mouth and obeyed the rules. Another temp was let go and bypassed from a previous hiring and  I didn’t want to see him let go, so I tried to help him know the rules, people to watch out for (tattle tales, rude people, managers, etc).\n\n He acts appreciative at first, then acts like I’m the tattle tale since supposedly no one  else tells him about the 5 hour lunch requirement and he says,  “I’ve worked union before and we always took out lunch whenever we want to”  Thus was after  I tell him twice he should not take lunch after 5 hours. I walk away and when I see him later I said “ what you said about telling on you,  bothers me. I was a temp worker once,   had people help me. I just want to see you get hired” We have had people written up for taking late lunches. His reply” I have worked union for 20 years, I know more than you do how a union is ran” The kicker He says,  “ I never asked for your help, did I”. \n\nThen after ignoring him for a few days I see him  come waking toward me heading to lunch with a big ol shit grin on his face. He was coming toward the break room for lunch after 5.5 hours  and right after I was done with my lunch which started at 5 hours. He acts like he can do whatever the hell he wants.

{"id": "lpck8r7", "text": "That's one of the problems with companies that have a \"my way or the highway\" management style and a unionized workforce. It's an adversarial relationship. And when the probationary period is over, the power dynamic changes. When that happens, you can expect things like that.\n\nAs a tradesman (industrial maintenance mechanic) I've worked in both union and non union environments. Of the two, I preferred the non union environments where the employer/employee relationship was a \"give and take\" kind of arrangement and the mindset was \"We're all adults here.\" Those jobs had the best work environment and the arrangement worked out well for the companies and everyone in them. Tradesmen would \"go the extra mile\" when business needs required it and they were asked to do so not to avoid being threatened, but because they were treated like people instead of as though they were a part of the machinery. And managers appreciated it when its skilled professional tradesmen would go \"above and beyond\" to help them out of a jam, saving them lots of money and headaches. These are truly team environments, voluntary and not out of compulsion.\n\nThe most toxic environments where I've worked in were those where management had a \"my way or the highway\" approach and no union to deal with. It didn't take long for me to hit the highways in those mismatched environments. And on my way out I took a few of them with me.

I'm not even sure how to respond to this in a way that conveys an apologetic tone at this point, but before I can really do anything about it, our Quality Assurance manager comes in and tells me that we have to suspend a very senior security employee for MASSIVE HIPAA breaches, and it took about another hour to sort out the very obviously charged situation.\n\nAfter this, I had a lot of processing to do for these violations, as we needed our ducks in a row prior to having to conduct an investigation. This took a minute, and I completely forgot to call the candidate back before I left. I sent an apology to the candidate the next day, but not before he *sent an email to our hiring manager basically stating that he was not going to take the position simply because of me, and that I was likely costing our facility dozens of good candidates due to the \"questionable practices\" we use*. Then also said something about not getting an invite to the Teams call until the morning of the interview. Well the hiring manager forwarded this to the director, and our CEO. I felt pretty bad about the entire thing, but sent apologies to the hiring manager for this. My boss gave me a talking to, but seemed to understand that I was busy. But the hiring manager and CEO are both pissed. \n\nNow, I've gotten our facility staffed so well that we only have a 10% vacancy rate, where it was almost double that when I arrived. All this considered, I'm actually a little terrified that I might get fired for this because it makes me look like I don't care at all.", "timestamp": "2024-09-25T18:58:02Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "The entitlement, anger, and insults from job candidates these days [MN]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/1fpb056/the_entitlement_anger_and_insults_from_job/"}}

If leadership is married to process, you probably won't persuade them to abandon all these steps, but you might persuade them to stick with one assessment and the presentation. Scrap the calendar and sample content.\n* You might consider paying candidates for their time. I have done this a few times. They complete the screening assignments, and I cut them a check.\n* I have also created a document outlining that we, the company, will not use any work produced during the screening process if we do not hire, and they own the work and may use it as they please.\n* Finally, we are very transparent and disclose during the initial screening call what all the steps will be. This works far better than surprising a candidate at each turn. \n\nAt the same time, I think it's important that a hiring process roughly mirror what work at an organization is like, and for that reason, I'm not completely bothered by our own process because it's a glimpse of what working with us will be like.

That helped me. \nExample:\n- we initially had 40 applicants. 20 were not qualified. 20 met the requirements.\n- 15 responded to a quick zoom meeting request. Of those, 12 were interested in the role, spoke well, and selected to move forward. \n- only 4 responded to request for assessment and work samples. This appears to be where candidates who are qualified and were interested before this step are dropping out of the process.\n\nShow them the time/money lost to this process. Ex: “we had 3 potentials who could have been a great fit but were not willing to complete these steps due to the time commitment. This caused us to recruit for an additional 2 months and the department incurred $3k of overtime costs due to being short staffed.”\n\nOr shit, tell them to complete the assessments themselves so they really understand the time and energy commitment they’re asking of people (who aren’t being paid!). You could market it as “these assessments are also useful for the existing team to understand how best to communicate or manage.”\n\nYou could also ask them: what information are you gathering during this additional step? Could that information also be gathered by reviewing the resume more closely, or during an interview? If so, then the process is redundant. \n\nFor example, if they insist “well I need to see a writing sample to make sure they can communicate well” you could say “the requirement of a bachelors degree, the format and verbiage of their resume, and the required 3 years of office experience should all show you that they have already proven they can communicate adequately.”\n\nOr “well I want to know more about their personality type”.

Ask which finance administrative person can assist you with the administrative struggles of scheduling interviews, and completing reservation and menu options for the exec retreat. And clarify what you need to produce vs what someone else can help with to allow you to focus on truly HR tasks.\n3. Ask your boss and the finance director if their teams will have capacity to train all 15 new staff members at the same time or if they'd like to plan to stagger hire dates to accommodate training needs. Or if you can change support to an initial screening for qualifications and hiring managers scheduling interviews for their selected candidates. \n4. Don't chase hiring managers, check in weekly. Communicate clearly about your expectations and your availability given to enlarge volume and pending open enrollment so that they're not shocked when you maintain that boundary.\n5. Use DND settings &amp; voicemail and say No to non essential things. Offer to reschedule after the exec retreat due to volume.

I didn't screen more technical positions and instead had the manager do all of that and connect with me when they have who they'd like to hire. It's not like they could work until their background check cleared. \n\nNext, talk to your boss or the sales team. That meeting is a sales director's problem. Just because you're HR doesn't make you the office manager, admin assistant, or whatever other position that they think does this. If they need a team building activity or training, then provide contact info. They can shop and submit a requisition for what they want/need. \n\nFor OE, do you not have a broker who can take care of the forms and information packets and even an overview slideshow? I'm not exactly sure what you do but with my company size and number of eligible employees I end up scheduling a week where I sit in an open location and present or have 1x1 with interested employees. Most cases I have had an employee only ask if there's cost changes, new benefits, pros/cons if they leave for their spouses plan.\n\nNext, put general office hours in place for employee relations things. It helped me to expect to be interpreted during the day with a walk-in and to be mindful of setting pause/stopping points in my projects. \n\nLastly, as you said, you are only one person, if hiring someone doesn't happen in the timeframe wanted, that's okay! You're going to have to advocate for yourself and be straightforward with individuals and tell them that it's perfect storm and you're anticipating delays in [fill in the blank] by 1-4 weeks or what timeframe you feel is realistic.\n\nHave a discussion with your boss as well sharing a plan to help you get through this busy period.

It also sounds like the company might be valuing the wrong things (quantity vs quality) which is unfortunate. \n\nAs I read through your post there looks to be two things which may help the stress. 1. Manage hiring manager expectations and 2. Advocate for yourself and your bandwidth (within reason).\n\nAll hiring managers want the unicorn. Hell, I want the unicorn too. But it’s my job to educate managers on what the market looks like and to understand what they need vs what they want. In most cases someone who meets 70% of the requirements can be successful in the role. \n\nYou mentioned that you are absorbing interviews for another sr recruiter. It very well could be to give you the exposure of screening candidates which is fine but if it’s taking away from your own reqs then I’d speak with them about how much you are taking on. The reqs you are solely responsible for should be first priority. \n\nRecruiting in general is all about building relationships and time management. Your internship should be aimed at developing these skills. Master them and you will be successful.

{"id": "mh5p5dk", "text": "Hey there,\n\nA few recommendations from me, I’ve been a recruiter and HR Manager for several years:\n\n-Tighten up your summary to a couple of sentences. Keep it short and sweet focused on your passion, skills, and what you are seeking in a new role. \n\n-highlight your skills in a separate section (such as project management, communication, etc.), and I would recommend reducing some content elsewhere to make space for this. \n\n-Reduce the bullets under each job experience and add one to three “Key Achievements” that you did at each place of work. This shows the hiring manager you can get stuff done. Use metrics where you can under the Key Achievements heading. E.g. “Launched new onboarding system in (year), onboarding over 50 new hires”\n\n-Focus on quality not quantity of experiences. Hiring managers want to know “what you achieved” and what skills you bring that make you a great fit for the job. \n\n-Add a volunteering or educational section (but keep it short and sweet) if you don’t already have it. If you’ve done volunteering it shows that you give back to causes and can juggle multiple commitments. I think it helps to show your trainings, education, or certificates in their own section (if you have a few to share). \n\n-Weave in some key words from each job posting and tweak your resume for each role once you are happy with your “base resume” (which is the one you can tinker with for each job)\n\n-Add your LinkedIn account to your resume somewhere. Chances are this resume will be reviewed on company systems so links work great. Make sure your LinkedIn account is updated, has a good photo, and updated “About Me” section, with experience and skills, and what job you are looking for. \n\nLastly, remember, a recruiter or hiring manager only has about 30 seconds to a minute to review your resume before they move to the next. Make sure you stand out, keep things tidy and clean, and focus on those skills, and achievements that highlight who you are. \n\nGood luck and happy hunting!", "timestamp": "2025-03-11T05:33:08Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "Resume Advice?

Here's where I'd start (keep in mind that you may have already done some of all of this).  \n\nFirst, interview the hiring managers about their best employees and their worst hires.  Figure out what makes their best hires their best hires, and their worst hires their worst hires.  I'd hone in on skills, traits, and competencies that are identified through the manager interviews.  Then create a scorecard based on that feedback that with graded answers that you can use to put data in front of your STEM-minded managers to show them why  a candidate is good or not.  Based on the needs and budget of the company, you might also consider implementing some type of selection assessment.

{"id": "e3tw9fa", "text": "Your client's chief complaint is the young people they hire don't seem to be able to produce good work product or conform to the workplace culture (showing up between 9 and 5). \n\nAre they sure this is a talent acquisition challenge and not something related to their management style and culture? \n\nIf this were my client, I would want to do a full, 360-degree examination of the new hire experience. How they recruit and vet candidates is definitely important, but you can't overlook what the new hires experience in the form of their onboarding, management, and employee development. \n\nFor instance, the symptom of not producing a good work product sounds more like a management problem than anything else. How are these new hires being coached and mentored? Are there any processes in place to demonstrate what an acceptable work product is? How are they supposed to know what is and what is not acceptable? Are they given a chance to be corrected, or does management grumble about making yet another bad hire as soon as the first mistake is made? \n\nWhat does this employer's onboarding process look like? Is it a quick tour of the bathrooms and vending machines before sitting down to fill out benefits forms, or a fully formed 90-day[ onboarding program ](https://www.saplinghr.com/blog/90-day-onboarding-plan) where managers establish expectations, inquire about goals, and provide training as well as a plan for future development? \n\nNow I'm sure you could help your client develop a strategy for identifying the candidates who are going to require the least amount of hand-holding, but even the most ambitious self-starter needs frequent validation, encouragement, and communication from her boss. You can screen candidates for basic skills, and some clever interview questions can help you figure out whether someone would be a good fit with the company culture, but once you bring them on, you still have to show them how to best be part of the team. \n\nIf I were in your shoes, I'd ask to see the onboarding program. If the client says, \"Oh, we don't have one,\" then you can add some recommendations to your review. I'd also ask to see how managers are expected to deliver criticism and feedback. Are there official processes in place? Any training? If not, another item for your review. \n\nAnd then you have the matter of people not showing up between 9 and 5. \n\nYour client is a tech company. It's not uncommon for tech companies to have liberal seat-time and PTO policies. If a candidate's peers in tech are enjoying positions where they have unlimited vacation days, generous remote work possibilities, and management that doesn't care if they want to hit the gym and run some errands before sitting down in the late a.m. to crank out code until after dinner time, then your client's 9-5 culture is going to come as a shock. \n\nThe client can either change the culture to accommodate the expectations of its young workforce, or it can own its culture and broadcast its benefits to possible applicants on its careers page, social media presence, and recruiting content before the hire and enforce those benefits in an onboarding program after the hire. \n\nSo what does your client's recruiting process look like? How do potential candidates learn about the company and what it's like to work there? What does the company's careers page look like? How are they communicating with candidates before interview invitations are sent out?\n\nCandidates visit a company's careers page to see if they can envision themselves working there. If your client has neglected its careers page, or if that page only serves the role of a job board, there is no way for potential applicants to know if they would be a cultural match. \n\nWhile the careers page should absolutely list open positions, it should also showcase your client's most compelling candidate content. This is great opportunity to highlight the company's mission and values and let candidate's join your client's[ talent community](https://yello.co/blog/what-is-a-talent-community/). \n\nFinally, if you want to know more about how [inbound recruiting](https://yello.co/blog/the-ultimate-inbound-recruitment-marketing-guide/), [candidate relationship management software](https://yello.co/recruitment-crm/), and [video interviewing](https://yello.co/video-interview-software/) solutions can help your client avoid inviting bad candidates to interview in the first place, please let me know via a PM. \n\nCheers!", "timestamp": "2018-08-08T15:43:25Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "Looking for testing/interviewing resources to screen candidates for employment.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/95fbwd/looking_for_testinginterviewing_resources_to/"}}

So if People Lead is truly an HR coordinator position, theoretically you could take a same title position at an organization or with experience move up to a specialist or generalist role.\nAlso if people lead counts as a real HR job, if you have 1-3 years experience, you can take the PHR test or if you have the upper side, the SHRM-CP (which it in itself is as valuable as a masters in HR).

The scope of her role may have grown significantly, but without knowing the details its pretty difficult to discuss anything tangibly.\n\nIn most orgs I've worked with (spanning small to med, state gov, multi nationals, ngo and consulting), finance and bean counters are generally in one department.\nIn construction, if they have project accounting duties, they'd certainly be stretched too thin, if there isn't a project/site based resource as well (depending on the scale of the projects, bidding processes, etc). Think about all the invoicing and payments involved with commercial construction projects. Think about the time it takes to prepare a bid or tender for any larger scale project. Do you use sub contractors, or solely employees? This is a shit tonne of stuff to keep track of. \n\nWith this growth, its not just about taking on additional resource, it's about making sure the org structure is fit for purpose and is somewhat future proofed. A successful company can very quickly lose everything that made it successful in the first place, in these periods of growth. \n\nDo you have a financial controller or cfo?

These are harder to “AI game” and give a much clearer view of how someone actually thinks or prioritises.\n\nIf you’re interested, I’ve got a guide that outlines some practical steps to make applications more resistant to generic AI responses.
